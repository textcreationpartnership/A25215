         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<q>
                  <l>An <hi>heaven-born-Truth</hi> (like poor mens infants) <hi>may</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Among the many diſcouragements I ſtruggled with in anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your <hi>deſires</hi> and the <hi>Doctors Sermon,</hi> there was none more terrifying (though many ſo) than that it was a <hi>Sermon,</hi> and a Sermon premunited with the <hi>Lord Mayors Order.</hi> The <hi>former;</hi> becauſe it ſeem'd indecent to Arraign a Diſcourſe, that came with the Certificate of <hi>the God of Heaven,</hi> and had ſo honourably been acquitted by the <hi>Gods on Earth:</hi> To this I had nothing to ſay in my Defence, but that, <hi>He that will plead the priviledg of the ſanctuary, muſt keep within the verge of it.</hi> I have heard of a Gentleman, that being long proſecuted in the <hi>high Commiſſion</hi> for ſtriking a <hi>Reverend Clergy-man,</hi> pleaded that <hi>Mr. Parſon</hi> was not in his <hi>Canonical Habiliments,</hi> and therefore ought not to inſiſt upon his character; and <hi>Archbiſhop Laud</hi> voted for the poor

mans diſcharge, becauſe it was but <hi>Lay-battery</hi> to cudgel <hi>a Coat;</hi> which would have been <hi>Theomachy</hi> upon a <hi>Caſſock:</hi> I muſt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the ſame Plea; That the <hi>Reverend Doctor</hi> ought not to ſtand upon the priviledg of a Preacher, unleſs he had kept cloſer to his Commiſſion, and preacht <hi>nothing for,</hi> but what <hi>really was</hi> the <hi>Word of God:</hi> But to be open with you, Sir, It was the latter that put me hardeſt to it, when I ſaw the flag of <hi>London</hi> ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Ship; for I proteſt to you, I am always ready to ſtrike ſail to the meaneſt <hi>Yatch</hi> that hangs out the Colours of ſo ſacred <hi>a Name,</hi> ſo great <hi>an Authority:</hi> And yet I rub'd through that, by conſidering, that the <hi>Order</hi> was for <hi>its Printing,</hi> not againſt <hi>my Anſwering;</hi> and though that <hi>Licenſe</hi> made it more <hi>vendible,</hi> yet not at all more <hi>unanſwerable;</hi> and ſo I hope we are paſt the worſt, for I never much Dread thoſe Polemical pieces, whoſe greateſt ſtrength lies in <hi>the left-hand Page before the Title.</hi> And yet I was a little ſtumbled at the <hi>Order,</hi> which deſires the Doctor <hi>to Print,</hi> not only <hi>what he had preached, but what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had prepared to deliver at that time;</hi> which (me-thought) lookt ſomewhat like the Implicit faith required by the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> which enjoyns the Miniſter to <hi>uſe one of the Homilies</hi> ſet forth, <hi>or hereafter</hi> to be ſet forth <hi>by Common Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the very entrance of his <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory,</hi> the Doctor takes notice of <hi>a Report raiſed,</hi> it ſeems, <hi>by ſome ill men</hi> (that's the Alamode phraſe) <hi>that he intended to ſtir up the Magiſtrates and Judges to a perſecution of Diſſenters.</hi> I was not a little troubled, that a perſon of his Character ſhould be ſo unworthily miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and miſinterpreted; and no leſs joyful, that the Doctor has ſo timely and zealouſly diſclaimed a deſign ſo horrid in it ſelf, ſo unbecoming the Place he then bore, and the Title he juſtly wears; nor can I imagine whence a ſuſpicion, as <hi>ſcandalous</hi> as <hi>groundleſs,</hi> could be foſter'd, except from this one thing, That his Sermon was preach't to thoſe <hi>Righteous perſons, who</hi> (in the matter of Conformity) <hi>needed no repentance,</hi> when the Harangue had been more pertinent and proper for a Conventicle, to thoſe <hi>Sinners</hi> whom he preſumes to need it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49933:3"/>But ſo far was he from blowing up the coals of perſecution, that he profeſſes <hi>his only deſign was to prevent all occaſion of it, by finding out a certain foundation for a laſting union among our ſelves.</hi> And not without good reaſon: for ſeeing there are but <hi>two ways</hi> to extinguiſh a raging fire, <hi>the one</hi> by pouring water upon that mercileſs Element, <hi>the other</hi> by withdrawing the fewel that <hi>feeds,</hi> but never <hi>fills</hi> its inſatiable appetite; the Dr. judg'd it the wiſer courſe to convert all the Diſſenters, that there might be nothing to burn; rather than leaving ſuch combubiſtle mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to quench the fiery fury of perſecution: for if there were no offenders, there would neither be room for <hi>pardoning mercy,</hi> nor <hi>vindicative juſtice;</hi> and if he could perſwade all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form upon ſuch eaſie arguments, the whole Generation, Kind, and Tribe of Eccleſiaſtical Informers, muſt be extinct, and fail for ever.</p>
            <p>However, an <hi>union,</hi> and a <hi>laſting union;</hi> and a <hi>foundation,</hi> nay <hi>a certain foundation</hi> for <hi>that laſting union,</hi> are terms of that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious chime to our ears, that his tendries muſt needs be highly acceptable, even when their diſproportionateneſs to thoſe ends give us feeble hopes that they will prove effectual.</p>
            <p>All <hi>union</hi> that pretends to be <hi>laſting,</hi> muſt be <hi>real</hi> and <hi>cordial;</hi> and that it may be ſo, muſt neceſſarily be founded upon <hi>terms conſiſtent with the conſcientious principles</hi> of the united parties: <hi>force</hi> may poſſibly juſtle and thruſt men into <hi>one place,</hi> but never into <hi>one mind;</hi> and <hi>fraud</hi> may palliate for a while the threatning <hi>ſymptoms,</hi> but will never eradicate the <hi>cauſes</hi> of the <hi>malady:</hi> ſuch was that union between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Churches,</hi> haſtily patcht up in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> where his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> like an old bungling Botcher ſtitcht together the two <hi>ill-matcht</hi> pieces, which preſently dropt aſunder, and the <hi>rent was made worſe.</hi> All <hi>dough-bak'd Alliances</hi> will give again; and thoſe differences which are compromiſed upon unequal terms, laſt no longer than a fair juncture ſhall tempt the aggrieved party to a rupture. So have we ſometime ſeen a mighty Conqueror impoſe ſuch terms upon the conquered, that they ſuppoſe it <hi>one tacit Article</hi> in the Peace,
<pb facs="tcp:49933:4"/>
That it ſhall endure no longer than the injured and weaker ſide can get power to juſtifie its violation.</p>
            <p>This <hi>laſting <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> (the Doctor thinks) <hi>is impoſſible to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, till men are convinced of the evil and danger of the preſent Separation:</hi> but others think (with equal plauſibleneſs) that <hi>it is impoſſible to be attained till men are convinced of the evil and danger of the preſent Impoſitions:</hi> and the Dr. was once of that mind, when he proved ſo learnedly, <hi>Iren.</hi> p. 1, 2. That <hi>things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Churches peace muſt be clearly revealed:</hi> Which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple had he and others adhered to, his <hi>Weapon-ſalve for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wounds</hi> had been as common and famous as the <hi>ſympathetical Powder</hi> which Sir <hi>K. Digby</hi> aſſures us is in <hi>France</hi> ſucceſsfully practiſed by every Barber. But why is Union impoſſible but upon ſuch conviction? Is it impoſſible for the ſame Power that impoſed theſe ſevere conditions of Union, to relax and remit them? We uſe to ſay, <hi>Eodem modo quo quid Inſtituitur, deſtitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> There's no more goes to Repeal a Law, than to Enact it: Nay, it's more poſſible for our <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> to wave what they confeſs <hi>indifferent,</hi> than for the <hi>Laity</hi> to comply with what they judg <hi>ſinful.</hi> But if inexorable ſtiffneſs has made their <hi>condeſcention impoſſible,</hi> who created the impoſſibility? If Union (as matters now ſtand) is become <hi>deſperate,</hi> who put matters into that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate poſture?</hi> It's unreaſonable that any ſhould create a <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſeparation,</hi> and then complain of an <hi>impoſſibility of union:</hi> but 'tis eaſily obſerved, that men to conciliate repute to their own humors, call what they have a mind to, <hi>abſolutely neceſſary;</hi> and that to which they bear an averſion, <hi>ſimply impoſſible.</hi> The Grandees of the Church knew full well, that the generality of the Nation who ſeriouſly attended Religion, had contracted ſuch principles as either condemned the Ceremonious appendages as <hi>ſinful</hi> or <hi>unuſeful,</hi> and therefore <hi>ſinful</hi> becauſe <hi>unuſeful:</hi> they knew well alſo, that theſe Impoſitions had loſt much of that ſtock of credit upon which they had formerly ſet up for themſelves, and driven a pretty trade among us: They muſt needs know too, that to perpetuate the <hi>old Conditions,</hi> would be but to perpetuate <hi>old

diviſions,</hi> and create <hi>new ones;</hi> why then would they venture ſo precious a lading as <hi>Peace,</hi> in that old worm-eaten <hi>bottom,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it muſt certainly miſcarry? But if it be impoſſible to attain Union at cheaper rates with <hi>men,</hi> we muſt look up to <hi>Him</hi> to whom nothing is <hi>impoſſible,</hi> who can open <hi>their eyes to ſee the things that belong to our</hi> common <hi>peace;</hi> and in the mean time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to diſcharge the things that <hi>belong to our duty,</hi> and bear thoſe evils which ſhall attend them. What a fine world now muſt moderate and unconcerned Chriſtians have between theſe two, ſome have ſworn to <hi>endeavour a Reformation according to the word of God,</hi> and others ſeem to have taken a ſolemn Oath never to come up to that Rule; and between them both, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well! ſay what we will or can, it's <hi>impoſſible to attain a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion till</hi> Diſſenters <hi>are convinc'd of the evil of</hi> their <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Pray then convince them of it! That he will do with a wet finger; for <hi>the preſent Separation</hi> (ſays the Doctor) <hi>is carried on by ſuch principles as not only overthrow the preſent conſtitution of our Church, but any other whatſoever.</hi> If that be the worſt on't, we'l endeavour to carry it on by <hi>better principles</hi> that ſhall <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw neither;</hi> will that pleaſe him? But what if I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; <hi>that the preſent Impoſitions</hi> are ſupported <hi>by ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> as will divide, <hi>not only our Church, but any Church whatſoever.</hi> This would be but a <hi>Rowland</hi> for his <hi>Oliver:</hi> And I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what confident, that fairer probabilities may be offer'd for <hi>this</hi> Aſſertion, than <hi>the other;</hi> for as to <hi>matter of fact,</hi> it's moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that from the firſt Infancy of the Goſpel-ſtate, when the Church was in its <hi>Minority of years,</hi> and <hi>Adult</hi> ſtate of <hi>perfection,</hi> to this very day, nothing has more diſorder'd the outward face of the Church, than the Lordly, Imperious Impoſition of dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matters: Thus the <hi>Judaizing</hi> Dogmatizers, who would ſtretch all mens Conſciences to their own Laſt, and compel them to a conformity to the antiquated Law of Moſes, began the brawl, and their ſucceſſors in pride have danced after their meaſures, to the World's confuſion. Nor has any Engine of the Devil more
<pb facs="tcp:49933:5"/>
batter'd and ſhaken the well-compacted Walls of God's <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> than theſe roaring Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Canons:</hi> And if we examine the <hi>principles</hi> upon which they proceed in exacting theſe unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and doubtful terms of Union, we ſhall find them the very ſame upon which proud <hi>Rome</hi> has introduced the whole Lirry of her ſuperſtitious Obſervances, <hi>viz.</hi> an unaccountable power in thoſe that are the Top, to make them do and ſay any thing that are at the Bottom; in which Obſervances, and upon which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the Chriſtian World never yet united, and it's more than probable never will.</p>
            <p>But I intend not to confront, but modeſtly examine the truth of the Doctor's Aſſertion, namely, Whether <hi>the preſent Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be carried on by ſuch principles as not only overthrow the preſent Conſtitution of our Church, but of any other whatſoever.</hi> And there are two Inquiries I ſhall make upon this ſubject: Firſt, Whether <hi>the principles by which the Separation is carried on, will deſtroy any other Church?</hi> Which if it be true, and that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting-Churches are built upon ſuch mouldering foundations, ſuch ſelf-deſtroying principles, it is next to miracle that they ſhould yet ſtand, and neither fall with their <hi>own weakneſs,</hi> nor the <hi>weight</hi> of Oppreſſion wherewith they have been ſurcharged; that they ſhould be continually <hi>batter'd</hi> with <hi>violence</hi> from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and <hi>undermined</hi> by <hi>policy</hi> from <hi>beneath,</hi> and yet no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable breach be made in their intrinſick Frame and Conſtitution! Now to put this Queſtion out of all queſtion, I will make a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable motion, Leave the Diſſenters quietly to overthrow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by <hi>their own bad principles,</hi> and ſo ſhall the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> avoid the <hi>odium</hi> of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> which of late has no very good name; and the Separators as <hi>Felones de ſe,</hi> ſhall be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have a ſtake driven through them, who, like the <hi>fooliſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> pluckt down <hi>their own houſe</hi> upon <hi>their own heads, with their own hands.</hi> Give them but reſpite from outward fury, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to be crumbled to nothing by the inconſiſtency of their own principles; and they muſt lay upon themſelves, not the Church, the guilt of their own deſtruction. The Diſſenters have
<pb facs="tcp:49933:5"/>
outlived <hi>one twenty years</hi> of vexation; and if men could be quiet, may outlive twenty more, and in time outgrow all their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; ſo that it may tempt an Impartial Conſiderer to think their preſent conſtitution immortal, which no outward aſſaults, no inward Schiſms has been able to diſſolve. There are two things uſually pleaded for the <hi>ſouls Immortality; the one,</hi> that it's not compounded of Contraries, ſuch as by inteſtine jars may diſſolve its eſſence; <hi>The other,</hi> that it's not obnoxious to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Impreſſions, ſuch as may ſtorm, and break in piece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And on both thoſe accounts, the Diſſenters humbly hope their Congregations may prove Immortal, ſeeing they have not felt utter ruine from <hi>the latter,</hi> and do not much fear a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from <hi>the former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us a little enquire, what truth there may be in the other branch of the Doctors Propoſition; <hi>That the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is carried on by ſuch principles as will overthrow the preſent conſtitution of the Church of England.</hi> I ſhall not aſſume the confidence to ſay, That then its preſent conſtitution is none of the beſt and ſtrongeſt: but this I may with modeſty aſſert, That the principles upon which the Diſſenters proceed, will <hi>pluck down</hi> nothing that <hi>Chriſt ever built,</hi> nor <hi>pluck up</hi> any thing that <hi>Chriſt ever planted;</hi> and if they ſhould <hi>pluck up</hi> a few weeds which <hi>the envious one</hi> threw over the hedg, whileſt men ſlept, the good corn would thrive the better for ſuch weeding; if they ſhould <hi>pluck down</hi> a few Imaginations which curioſity has carved, and ſet up in the <hi>Nitches</hi> on the outſide of the Church-wall, the main of the Fabrick would ſtand more firm, diſcharg'd of a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs cumber, without prejudice to the foundation: Some few <hi>Traditions,</hi> ſome few unſcriptural <hi>Additions,</hi> ſome ſupernume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or ſome few <hi>Encroachments</hi> upon Chriſts Regal and Prophetical Offices their principles might overthrow: but what are theſe, all theſe, to the being, the well-being, the flouriſhing being of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Is it true, that <hi>no Ceremony, no Epiſcopacy?</hi> Was ever a Church built upon ſuch <hi>Woolſacks?</hi> Such diſcourſes as theſe tempt us to ſuſpect there's
<pb facs="tcp:49933:6"/>
nothing <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> in that Conſtitution, which cannot ſubſiſt without theſe <hi>accidents.</hi> Are Ceremonies grown ſuch Inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Adjuncts, that they cannot <hi>Abeſſe ſine ſubjecti Interitu?</hi> We may as well fancy, that to ſcowr off the ruſt, will deſtroy the Iron; or that it's impoſſible to waſh the face, without fleying of the skin: as that a Reformation, according to Gods word, will draw along with it the inevitable ruine of that Church which is founded on it, and reformed by it: And if it reſt upon any other <hi>Baſis,</hi> it needs the principles of none but it ſelf to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do it.</p>
            <p>I can allow the Doctor to ſee much farther into theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters than I; and yet I cannot be perſwaded that I am ſtark blind; and with the beſt eyes I have, or can borrow, cannot yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what prejudice it can be to them that worſhip God in a more ſpruce, ſplendid, gentile mode than we do, to ſuffer us to worſhip our God in his own, old, <hi>Scripture-faſhion:</hi> It cannot be denied, that the Proteſtant Churches in <hi>France</hi> are really ſeparated from the Papal <hi>Gallican Polity:</hi> It muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that their principles carry a direct oppoſition to thoſe of their Adverſaries, that their ſeparation from, and oppoſition to the National frame is much greater than that of Diſſenters from, and to the conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and yet the <hi>Roman</hi> Polity lives, and thrives, and proſpers, and no one of all the Popiſh Kingdoms bears a greater port, or glories more in its exteriour ſplendor and grandeur than that does: Why then cannot <hi>Conformiſts</hi> ſecure themſelves againſt the <hi>Diſſenters prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> as well as the <hi>Gallican Church,</hi> againſt thoſe of the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots?</hi> And why may not Diſſenters plead for the ſame freedom, eſpecially as to the immediate worſhip of God, and ordering their own particular Societies, ſince they plead for <hi>leſs</hi> here than they there enjoy, and yet upon <hi>much ſtronger arguments?</hi> for the Diſſenters at home plead for no power to ſet up <hi>Claſſes,</hi> and <hi>Synods, Provincial</hi> or <hi>National,</hi> which yet are there indulged them; and they think they might expect a little more reſpect, as being of one and the ſame <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and not guilty of
<pb facs="tcp:49933:6"/>
any principles which have any <hi>tendency,</hi> as they that own them have <hi>no deſign,</hi> to overthrow the preſent conſtitution of the Church; ſo that the Doctors Reaſonings are herein ſo unlike himſelf, ſo defective of that evidence and cogency wherewith he attacques the Papal Idolatry, that had I not known his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to have been <hi>Concio ad Magiſtratum,</hi> I might have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it to be nothing but <hi>Ad Populum phalerae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The principles upon which the preſent Separation (ſuch a one as it is) is carried on, are ſuch as fear not to appear before any Bar, where Scripture and Reaſon, not Intereſt and Prejudice have the Chair; which though it be not here pertinent to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,</hi> but nakedly to <hi>aſſert,</hi> leaving their Juſtification to thoſe larger Volumes which are in every mans hand concerned to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at ſatisfaction in theſe matters; yet ſhall I direct the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſome few of them:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That <hi>every particular Church upon a due ballance of all circumſtances, has an inherent right to chuſe its own Paſtor, and every particular Chriſtian the ſame power to chuſe his own Church;</hi> I ſay not they have a power to <hi>miſchuſe,</hi> but a power to <hi>chuſe;</hi> not to chuſe any, but one that may beſt advance their own edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; at leaſt that no Paſtor be forced upon a Church, no Church obtruded on a ſingle Chriſtian without their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: A principle ſo highly rational, ſo clearly ſcriptural, and of ſuch venerable Antiquity, as ought not upon ſome imaginary or pretended evil conſequences to be exploded, ſeeing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary principle is clogg'd with <hi>more real,</hi> than this can be with <hi>ſurmiſed Inconveniencies:</hi> I will thank my friends that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to my choice an able Phyſician, a faithful Lawyer; but I am ſure I love my health, my life, my eſtate ſo well, as not to put the Election out of my own hands into theirs, who are not likely to love me better than my ſelf: and if I chuſe amiſs, the greateſt wrong will be my own: Now what Church this principle would overthrow, I am yet ignorant; If indeed ſuch tyranny ſhould prevail in the world, that men muſt be driven to Heaven, like ſilly ſheep to the Market, and this principle
<pb facs="tcp:49933:7"/>
ſhould a little croſs the humour on't, the Churches of Chriſt would ſtand where they do, and I believe carry a clearer Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpart of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It is pretended, that upon this principle men would chuſe one Paſtor to day, another to morrow, and a third the next; and ſo turn round till they are giddy, or run themſelves out of breath in a wild-gooſe chaſe, till they ſit down, and reſt in Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and Irreligion: And is this all? The Apoſtle commands us to <hi>prove all things:</hi> muſt we needs therefore never <hi>hold faſt that which is good?</hi> We ought upon great deliberation, advice and counſel, chuſe our own Paſtor; and when we have ſo choſen, ſit down under Gods Ordinance, and wait for his preſence in, and bleſſing upon his own way: And in the pureſt Primitive times, when the Churches exerciſed this power moſt, then were they moſt firmly united, and Diviſions, Schiſms and Separations the greateſt rarities among them: but ſuppoſe the worſt on't; That ſome malecontent ſhould now and then deſert the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>England</hi> for that of <hi>Rome;</hi> Cruelties will never remedy the evil, or the Remedy would be worſe than the diſeaſe; and what if ſome odd <hi>Maggot-pate</hi> ſhould drop out with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters Congregations? what is all this to the overthrow of the Church? This priviledg may be <hi>abuſed,</hi> muſt it therefore not be <hi>uſed? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſetled heads,</hi> and <hi>unſtable hearts</hi> will be wandring; let them go; 'tis a good riddance of them if they be obſtinate; but where this humour has deſtroy'd one Church, this rigorous forcing of Paſtors upon the people has divided and deſtroyed hundreds.</p>
            <p>The generality of Diſſenters in this Nation, at this day may be reduced to two Heads:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such who having been formerly ſixt with, and under their faithful Paſtors, by their deliberate choice, after good expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their Miniſterial abilities to teach them the mind and will of God, of their wiſdom to adviſe them in their ſpiritual caſes; of their skill to conduct them through their emergent difficulties, of their meekneſs, ſobriety, heavenly-mindedneſs, and
<pb facs="tcp:49933:7"/>
whatever might recommend to, and inforce upon their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences their ſound Doctrine, do ſtill judg it their unqueſtionable duty to abide in that Relation, and by no terrours to be driven, by no blandiſhments to be withdrawn from their overſight and guidance, according to the word of God; judging that ſuch withdrawing, ſuch ſeparation would be that <hi>real Schiſm,</hi> which hears ſo badly in, and is loaded with ſuch guilt by the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond ſort</hi> is of thoſe who having been ſometime hearers at large in their reſpective Pariſh-Churches, and coming at laſt to have more concernment for their ſouls, and the important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of another world, and finding that their Parochial Teacher was either ſo <hi>overlaid</hi> with <hi>a numerous throng of people</hi> (which he commonly, but unadviſely calls his Flock and Charge) that he cannot perſonally take care of the hundredth part of them; or ſo engaged in <hi>ſecular affairs,</hi> of more weight to him than his Paſtoral Charge, that he has neither heart nor leiſure to attend ſo troubleſome an employment; or ſo <hi>unskilful in the word of Righteouſneſs,</hi> that he cannot tolerably declare the Counſel of God for edification; or ſo unſound in his judgment, that he's more likely to <hi>poyſon than feed</hi> his people; or ſo <hi>debauched in his life,</hi> that he plucks down more in an hour, than he builds up in a year; or ſuch a Bigot for humane Inventions and Superſtitions, that the naked ſimplicity of divine Worſhip, is either <hi>clouded</hi> to render it <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> or <hi>clogged</hi> to render it <hi>burdenſome;</hi> this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeeks and finds out ſome other Paſtor (qualified as before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed) to whoſe Miniſterial conduct under Chriſt (the only chief ſhepherd) he commits himſelf; and there peaceably and patiently continues, notwithſtanding the barbarick clamours of Schiſm and Separation: And all this without more prejudice to the Church he forſakes, then it's an injury to a Tradeſman to leave his ſhop, who has <hi>left it himſelf,</hi> or has his hands full of <hi>better cuſtomers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That <hi>it is the duty of every Chriſtian to worſhip God, not only in purity of the heart, but according to the purity of Goſpel-adminiſtrations:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49933:8"/>
The true meaſure of which Purity, is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from its conſonancy and harmony with the word of God, which has ſufficiently either in <hi>general, ſpecial,</hi> or <hi>particular</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed us in the acceptable ſervice of our God: <hi>Purity of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> is no ſuch idle and contemptible thing, to be flam'd off with an impertinent ſtory, that we muſt not ſeparate from a true Church upon <hi>pretence of greater purity:</hi> Nor can I imagine upon what pretence, except that of <hi>greater purity,</hi> the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> ſeparated from <hi>Rome,</hi> if it be true what we read in <hi>Rat. Account,</hi> p. 293. That <hi>the Church of Rome is a true Church;</hi> and what he further owns, <hi>Defence againſt T. G.</hi> p. 785. <hi>I allow</hi> (ſays the Doctor) <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be a true Church, as holding all the eſſential points of the Chriſtian faith:</hi> and what the Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> confeſſed to that Lady, who would needs go before to <hi>Rome</hi> alone, becauſe ſhe could not bear a crowd, that <hi>ſhe might be ſaved in Communion with the</hi> Roman <hi>Church:</hi> Now if <hi>Rome</hi> be a <hi>true Church,</hi> if ſhe holds <hi>all the eſſential points of Chriſtianity;</hi> If <hi>ſalvation may be attained in that Communion,</hi> why was there ſuch a ſtir about reforming of <hi>Accidents,</hi> when the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> were ſecured? Why ſuch a Conteſt about a little <hi>eaſier way,</hi> when the other way was <hi>paſſable?</hi> Why all this a-do about <hi>a purer Church,</hi> when the other is confeſſed <hi>a true Church?</hi> Theſe things then will follow in the lump from the Archbiſhops and Doctors Conceſſions: 1. That <hi>a perſon, or party may ſeparate from ſome true Church,</hi> which holds <hi>all the eſſential points of the Chriſtian faith,</hi> without the <hi>Imputation of a Schiſmatick.</hi> 2. That <hi>a perſon or party may ſeparate from ſome Church where ſalvation is attainable,</hi> without peril of the guilt of Schiſm. 3. That the only Reaſon (that yet appears) to juſtifie the <hi>Church of Englands</hi> departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> is, that it is lawful in <hi>ſome caſes</hi> to withdraw from the Communion of <hi>a true Church,</hi> wherein all <hi>the eſſential points of faith</hi> are owned, and wherein <hi>ſalvation may be attained;</hi> for the ſake of <hi>greater purity of worſhip,</hi> greater <hi>clearneſs of Doctrine,</hi> and greater <hi>ſecurity of ſalvation.</hi> Is it then lawful for <hi>England</hi> to ſeparate from <hi>Italy</hi> for <hi>greater purity?</hi> It
<pb facs="tcp:49933:8"/>
may be lawful for others to ſeparate from <hi>England</hi> for <hi>greater purity:</hi> 'Tis readily acknowledged, that the Impurity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Synagogue is much more, unconceivably more than that of <hi>the Church of England;</hi> and therefore there was not <hi>ſo great cauſe</hi> to leave the <hi>latter,</hi> as the former upon that account; but in aſpiring after Conformity to the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, we are not to conſider <hi>ſo much</hi> what is <hi>behind,</hi> as what is <hi>before;</hi> not ſo much what we have <hi>left,</hi> as what we have yet to <hi>reach;</hi> nor ſo much the <hi>Terminus aquo,</hi> from what ſtate of Impurity we have emerged; as the <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> to what ſtate of purity we would arrive: for if it be true that there is ſuch a ſtate of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be obtained, and ſuch a ſtate of Impurity to be avoided, as will juſtifie our forſaking of <hi>this</hi> for <hi>that;</hi> and ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of both theſe as <hi>will not;</hi> It muſt be exactly ſtated, what is the <hi>loweſt degree</hi> of corruption that will, and what is <hi>the higheſt</hi> that will not warrant a ſeparation: The <hi>Diſſenters being judges,</hi> there are enow at home to excuſe their ſeceſſion; The <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts being judges,</hi> there are not enow abroad to vindicate the <hi>Church of Englands</hi> ſeparation; and the former are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in their judgment, ſince the Doctors <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory</hi> to the now B. of <hi>London,</hi> prefixt to his <hi>Defence againſt T. G.</hi> where he openly avows on the behalf of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, that <hi>it has reformed thoſe abuſes only, which have crept in ſince the times of the firſt four general Councils:</hi> Now the laſt of theſe four firſt being held at <hi>Chalcedon, An.</hi> 451. there were ſuch Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions crept into the Church <hi>before that time,</hi> which if impoſed upon any as the condition of enjoying the means of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will juſtifie a ſeparation; but I ſhall the leſs inſiſt upon this, becauſe I am confident <hi>the Church of England</hi> never gave the Doctor <hi>a Commiſſion</hi> to declare ſo much in her name, and I believe will give him as <hi>little thanks</hi> for his labour.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That <hi>every Chriſtian is obliged</hi> (at leaſt <hi>neceſſitate praecepti) to live in the uſe of all Gods Ordinances and Commandments;</hi> and therefore it will follow, 1. That where all Chriſts Inſtitutions are <hi>not to be had,</hi> a Chriſtian may peaceably withdraw from that
<pb facs="tcp:49933:9"/>
ſociety, and ſeek them <hi>where he can find them:</hi> Now they ſay the caſe is this; That though we ought not to commit <hi>one ſin</hi> to enjoy all Chriſts Ordinances, yet there are <hi>ſome</hi> wanting in this Church, which if you would commit <hi>a thouſand ſins</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe you cannot have them: The preamble to the <hi>Office of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> intimates ſome ſuch matter. <hi>Brethren, in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church there was a godly Diſcipline, that at the beginning of</hi> Lent, <hi>ſuch perſons as were notorious ſinners, were put to open penance and puniſhment in this world, that their ſouls might be ſaved in the day of the Lord; and that others admoniſhed by their example, might be more afraid to offend: Inſtead whereof, until the ſaid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline may be reſtored again (which thing is much to be deſired); it is thought good, that at this time in your preſence ſhould-be read the general ſentences of Gods curſe againſt impenitent ſinners.</hi> Now view this paragraph well in its parts. 1. There was <hi>a godly diſcipline</hi> in <hi>the Primitive times,</hi> if we could have kept it. 2. That this diſcipline was of unſpeakable benefit to the people; <hi>notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinners were put to open ſhame,</hi> others <hi>warned by their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> and the end of all was the <hi>ſalvation of their ſouls.</hi> 3. That this Ordinance is <hi>not to be found</hi> in the Church at this day; which is a great loſs. 4. That it is a thing to be <hi>much deſired;</hi> and therefore it cannot but be worth the while to ſtep over <hi>two threſholds</hi> for it: it's worth <hi>a wiſh</hi> (if <hi>wiſhing</hi> would do it) with the moſt ordinary Chriſtian on earth. 5. That there's ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>ſet up inſtead of it;</hi> but <hi>quo warranto,</hi> we are not informed, nor who has power to <hi>chop and change</hi> any Inſtitution of his, for a new trick, <hi>a Quid pro Quo,</hi> contrived by men. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may fairly hope, we ſhall not be condemned for Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks for practiſing what they <hi>deſire to practiſe;</hi> but alas we <hi>can,</hi> and <hi>they cannot,</hi> becauſe <hi>none hinders them.</hi> 2. It will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low alſo, that where the Inſtitutions of Chriſt may be found, yet if they be fetter'd and chain'd to, or mixed with ſinful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, 'tis the ſame caſe as if they were not at all to be had; for <hi>we can do nothing, but what we can lawfully do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To name no more at preſent; we cannot have our <hi>Infants
<pb facs="tcp:49933:9"/>
baptized</hi> without the <hi>Aerial ſign of the Croſs,</hi> as a <hi>Medium</hi> whereby it is dedicated to Chriſt. What then ſhall we do? Here we may have <hi>a part or two</hi> of worſhip with innocency, and peace of conſcience: but if we will <hi>walk in all Chriſts inſtitutions,</hi> we muſt ſeek elſewhere: What ſhall we do then? muſt we ſpend our Lords days in an undecent trotting up and down the Town for one ſcrap here, a ſnap there? or ſhall we ſit down under a well-fixed order of Worſhip and Diſcipline, and joyn with other Congregations occaſionally in what they have? This is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral courſe of Diſſenters, and will deliver us from that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein they ſo much triumph, That <hi>though we cannot joyn with them in all parts of worſhip, yet are we bound to it ſo far as we are perſwaded it is lawful ſo to do:</hi> for we are fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded 'tis our duty to partake of, and communicate in <hi>every Ordinance</hi> of Chriſt, and therefore ſtatedly and fixedly to adhere to that Church, where, to that Paſtor by whom they are all adminiſtred, not neglecting other Congregations, as Providence ſhall invite, to participate of what they afford, and what with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin we may have.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) That <hi>it is ſinful to ſubmit, ſubſcribe aſſent to dubious and obſcure terms of Communion:</hi> How far this principle will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd <hi>us,</hi> I know not; but this I know, the <hi>Reverend Doctor</hi> once allow'd <hi>himſelf</hi> the benefit of it, when he juſtified the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the <hi>Church of England</hi> from <hi>Rome, Dialogue,</hi> p. 165. <hi>We think</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the requiring of doubtful things for certain, falſe for true, new for old, abſurd for reaſonable, is ground enough for us not to embrace communion with that Church, unleſs it may be had on better terms.</hi> And <hi>we think</hi> that this is ground enough for us, as well as himſelf, not to embrace the Communion of this Church, ſeeing there are impoſed upon us <hi>doubtful things for certain, new for old,</hi> and <hi>we think</hi> too, <hi>falſe for true;</hi> I ſay <hi>we think</hi> ſo; and it was but the Doctors <hi>[we think]</hi> that he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>T. G.</hi> And <hi>we think</hi> further, that this will vindicate us from thoſe loud, but empty outcrys of Schiſm and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; for ſo the Doctor aſſerts, <hi>Ibid. We have often proved, that
<pb facs="tcp:49933:10"/>
the impoſing unreaſonable conditions of Communion, makes the Church ſo impoſing guilty of the Schiſm.</hi> I have told the Doctor <hi>what we think,</hi> I will tell him now <hi>why we ſo think,</hi> that <hi>doubtful things</hi> are impoſed on us <hi>for certain, falſe for true;</hi> and among many others I aſſign this one inſtance, That in the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> of the Church, wherein the <hi>Laity</hi> are concern'd, this Doctrine is contained, That <hi>Infants perform faith and repentance by their ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> and ſuch repentance too, <hi>whereby they forſake ſin;</hi> and ſuch faith, <hi>whereby they ſtedfaſtly believe the promiſes of God made to them in that Sacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee, Sir, how the Importunity of the Doctor has drawn us out of our reſervedneſs; Diſſenters have been modeſt to their great prejudice, and had rather diſpute the matter upon other Arguments, than thoſe drawn from the ſinfulneſs and unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the things required, out of that great veneration they have ever had for the <hi>Church of England;</hi> and yet we hope, that they that call and invite, nay provoke, and force us to this task, will not be ſo diſingenuous to trapan us into the ambuſh of a penal Statute; it being unworthy of Gentlemen, and perſons of Honour, firſt to be our <hi>Tempters,</hi> and then our <hi>Accuſers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) That <hi>every Chriſtian is obliged to walk with, and in all the ways of God, ſo far as they have attained:</hi> ſo far as they have the knowledg of Gods Will, they are to live up to it; ſo far as they ſee their freedom from bondage, they are to ſtand faſt in it; ſo far as they are advanced towards a perfect reformation, they are to perſevere. All retrograde motions are dangerous; for who knows but that the leaſt declenſion from the ways of God may terminate in Apoſtacy? Foreſeeing Chriſtians therefore will not dare to tread back thoſe ſteps they have taken towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but rather will be preſſing forward to whatſoever degree of exactneſs in this life is attainable: We queſtion whether we ought not to <hi>aſpire and endeavour after greater purity;</hi> but it's paſt all queſtion with us, that we ought <hi>not to retreat to greater Impurity;</hi> Diſſenters are ſo far from divding, that they would be growing up into greater Union: they would walk as they
<pb facs="tcp:49933:10"/>
have <hi>attained to know,</hi> and would know more, that they may <hi>walk farther;</hi> know <hi>clearer,</hi> that they may walk <hi>holier;</hi> and for what they <hi>cannot attain</hi> by ſtudy, prayer, and the due uſe of all good means, they would humbly <hi>wait upon God, till he ſhall, and that he may reveal even that thing alſo unto them:</hi> But ſome are ſo haſty and impatient, that they will neither ſtay Gods leiſure, nor theirs, but drive knowledg into their heads, and their brains out of their heads, with the great Churchbeetle.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Laſtly, I have heard ſome of them own this principle, <hi>That where the Church has no power to command, there it cannot be the peoples duty to obey;</hi> for power to command, and obligation to obedience being Relatives, muſt be affirmed or denied equally and reciprocally: if then the Church has no power from Chriſt (and whence ſhe ſhould derive it but from him, I cannot divine) to impoſe theſe things in Controverſie, it can never be proved their duty to obey in the premiſes: 'Tis a ſad ſight to ſee how Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters have been teazed with that Text, <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order;</hi> but the clamour grows very weak from that Quarter: and now a <hi>new Text</hi> has been found out, which, they hope, will kill and ſlay all before it: <hi>As we have already attained, let's walk by the ſame rule;</hi> from whence they argue with ſingular acuteneſs, we muſt walk <hi>as we have</hi> attained, and therefore we muſt walk <hi>as we have not</hi> attained; if we be <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded</hi> we muſt wait till God <hi>reveal it to us;</hi> therefore, though we be <hi>otherwiſe minded,</hi> we muſt <hi>act as if like-minded;</hi> and though there be various degrees of light and knowledg, yet we muſt come up to an uniformity of practiſe, as if there were no variety of degrees; which makes a man a certain creature about <hi>ſix pence</hi> better than a horſe, though ſome think upon that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple he's <hi>a ſhilling worſe:</hi> But theſe Doctrines of the Doctors, are <hi>collected and raiſed</hi> from the Text, juſt as our <hi>Collectors raiſe</hi> a Tax upon indigent, non-ſolvent people, who come armed with <hi>a Law,</hi> and <hi>a Conſtable,</hi> to <hi>diſtrain</hi> for that which is not to be had, rather than <hi>the King ſhould loſe his Right;</hi> and certainly never was Text ſo <hi>ſtrained</hi> and <hi>diſtrained</hi> to <hi>pay</hi> what it <hi>never

owed;</hi> never man ſo <hi>Rack't</hi> to <hi>confeſs</hi> what he <hi>never thought;</hi> never was a Pumice-ſtone ſo ſqueez'd for water which it never held; nor ever a good Cauſe ſo miſerably put to its ſhifts, as <hi>to preſs</hi> thoſe innocent Texts <hi>againſt their wills,</hi> which refuſe to come in as <hi>Volunteers to the ſervice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding what has been ſaid; it ſhall ſtand for <hi>not-ſpoken,</hi> if the Doctor can prove his aſſertion, That <hi>the preſent Separation is carried on by ſuch principles as will overthrow any Church whatever:</hi> Thus then he proceeds. <hi>If it be lawful to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon pretence of greater purity, where there is an agreement in Doctrine, and the ſubſtantial parts of worſhip: then a bare differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in opinion, as to ſome circumſtantials in worſhip, and the beſt conſtitution of Churches, will be a ſufficient ground to break Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and ſet up new Churches.</hi> Now becauſe this <hi>dead weight</hi> always hangs lugging on one ſide, give me leave to put a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe on the other ſide, to make it hang more even: <hi>If it be lawful to impoſe the Ceremonies upon pretence of decency and order, and to exact ſubmiſſion to them upon pretence of Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, then may</hi> bare will and pleaſure <hi>be a ſufficient reaſon to raiſe the ſevereſt perſecution, to force Communion againſt conſcience, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the Churches of Chriſt on earth for a bare difference in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as to ſome circumſtances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us however with all tenderneſs examine this way of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, always proteſting; 1. That we will not be cheated with that expreſſion of <hi>pretence of greater Purity:</hi> for we do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>hypocriſie</hi> to be a ſufficient ground of Separation. 2. Nor with that other expreſſion, <hi>a bare difference in opinion,</hi> which we would explain both here, and hereafter, if we underſtood the meaning of it: Theſe things premiſed, I obſerve in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſome things <hi>prudently ſuppoſed,</hi> and thoſe ſuppoſals as <hi>wiſely improved. Firſt</hi> then, here are ſome things very <hi>prudently ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:</hi> As (1.) that <hi>there is a confeſſed agreement</hi> between the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering parties <hi>in Doctrine:</hi> But where ſhall we find that <hi>ſyſtem of Doctrine,</hi> in which the Agreement is ſuppoſed to lye? ſhall we ſeek it in the <hi>Holy Scriptures?</hi> In vain! one party can find <hi>a
<pb facs="tcp:49933:11"/>
Church-power there to make Canons,</hi> in which the other party ſhall be bound to acquieſce upon pain and peril of the guilt of Schiſm: but the Diſſenting-party can ſee <hi>no ſuch matter:</hi> Thoſe again have found a Doctrine there, that the Addition of any thing <hi>in ſpecie</hi> to Gods word or worſhip, which he has not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>in genere,</hi> is culpable; but the other party wonder where they pickt up this ungrateful Doctrine; ſhall we then go ſearch for this ſuppoſed, or confeſſed agreement in the 39 Articles? there, or no where, we may expect to meet with it; but here alſo are we miſerably diſappointed, for the Doctor himſelf has ſatisfied us in his <hi>Rational Account,</hi> p. 54, 55. That <hi>the learned Primate of Ireland</hi> (underſtand not B. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> but <hi>Bramhall) tells us the ſenſe of the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles</hi> of this Church. <hi>Neither doth the Church of</hi> England <hi>define any of theſe Queſtions neceſſarily to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, either</hi> neceſſitate praecepti, <hi>or</hi> Medii—<hi>but only bindeth her ſons for peace-ſake not to oppoſe them;</hi> And more fully in another place. <hi>We do not ſuffer any man to reject the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles of the Church of</hi> England <hi>at his pleaſure, yet neither do we look upon them as eſſentials of ſaving faith, or legacies of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, but in a mean, as pious opinions, fitted for the preſervation of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity; neither do we oblige any man to believe them, but not to contradict them.</hi> Now if this be true, I would fain learn how the Doctor can be ſo confident that we are agreed <hi>in Doctrine,</hi> when we are at a loſs, and wholly to ſeek <hi>in what Doctrine to agree?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are ſurprized (Sir!) I doubt not at this diſcovery: Has not <hi>the Church of England</hi> defined in her 39 Articles any thing <hi>neceſſarily to be believed?</hi> then it ſeems the <hi>eſſence and exiſtence of a God</hi> is not defined to be neceſſary. Are theſe Articles <hi>no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of ſaving faith?</hi> then it's no eſſential point of faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>Chriſt is the eternal Son of God.</hi> Are theſe but <hi>pious Opinions?</hi> then it's a pious Opinion that we are <hi>juſtified by faith without our own merits:</hi> Is it enough <hi>not to contradict them,</hi> and that we are <hi>not obliged to believe them?</hi> then an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> is agreed in the Article of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> if he has but wit enough to keep a good tongue in his head: And the <hi>Socinian</hi> is agreed in the
<pb facs="tcp:49933:12"/>
Article of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> the <hi>Papiſt</hi> agreed too in the Article againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> provided always they can but bite in their ſentiments; nay the Proteſtants at <hi>Rome</hi> are agreed in the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Trent,</hi> the Chriſtians in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> are agreed in the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> for I think they <hi>do not believe them,</hi> and yet have ſo much wit as <hi>not to contradict them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here they torment us with new-coyned Diſtinctions, of <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi> and <hi>ſecondary, affirmative</hi> and <hi>negative Articles;</hi> ſome <hi>more refined,</hi> others of an <hi>inferiour Alloy;</hi> Well then, let us ſuppoſe that the <hi>negative, ſecondary,</hi> the Articles of the <hi>lower Claſſis</hi> are not neceſſary to be believed in order to ſalvation; Are we agreed in the <hi>primary, affirmative,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>higheſt form?</hi> I doubt not! for granting that the Diſſenters <hi>aſſent to them,</hi> and the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters <hi>diſſent;</hi> or ſuppoſe on the other ſide, the <hi>Conformiſts agree</hi> to them, and the <hi>Nonconformiſts diſagree;</hi> 'tis all a caſe, they are in the ſame degree of diſtance from each other: Now the plain truth is this; The Diſſenters generally agree with <hi>that book,</hi> which is commonly called the 39 Articles, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled above a hundred years ago, and this <hi>book</hi> ſome men call <hi>the Church of England;</hi> but then they are far from Agreement with the leading Clergy-men of this generation (who as near as we can gheſs do conſtitute the Church): And this is certain, that the Rulers and Teachers of the Church do really differ from one another, and therefore Diſſenters muſt needs differ from ſome of them; but which of them is the Church, we know not; If <hi>both parties,</hi> the Church muſt neceſſarily be of <hi>two Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions;</hi> and ſo this pretended agreement is not <hi>real</hi> and <hi>ſincere,</hi> but <hi>notional, ſpeculative</hi> and <hi>imaginary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) 'Tis further ſuppoſed, that the diſagreeing parties are yet <hi>agreed in the ſubſtantial parts of worſhip:</hi> To which I muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 1. That we know of no Commiſſion, no Charter granted by Chriſt to any Church, to inſtitute <hi>any parts of worſhip at all,</hi> whether <hi>ſubſtantial, integral,</hi> or <hi>circumſtantial,</hi> or by what other deviſed terms they be diſtinguiſhed, or confounded, 2. Nor have we heard of <hi>any Rule</hi> aſſigned by Chriſt to warrant them
<pb facs="tcp:49933:12"/>
how to diſterminate the <hi>ſubſtantial parts</hi> of worſhip from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral,</hi> or the <hi>integral parts</hi> from the <hi>circumſtantial:</hi> How eaſie a thing were it to demoliſh a <hi>ſubſtantial part</hi> of worſhip, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it to be only <hi>a circumſtantial part?</hi> or to magnifie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their own, which they have dreſt up like worſhip, and then exact Conformity to it, and Union in it in the Name of Chriſt? for it's a common obſervation, That when they would wheadle us into Compliance, then every thing is but <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;</hi> but when they proceed to chaſtiſe us for Nonconformity, then the ſame things are nick-named <hi>ſubſtantials,</hi> matters of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſuch as without which <hi>no Church, no Government, no Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> can poſſibly breathe or ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>And yet if the matter were well ſearcht into, perhaps we are not ſo clearly agreed in the <hi>ſubſtantial parts of worſhip:</hi> An <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward viſible ſign of an inward and inviſible grace, whereby a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is dedicated to the profeſſion of, and ſubjection to the Redeemer, is a ſubſtantial part of worſhip:</hi> If it be inſtituted by Chriſt, 'tis a <hi>divine, lawful part of worſhip,</hi> and he will bleſs it; If only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by man out of his great tenderneſs to ſupply the defects of Chriſts Inſtitution, this is alſo <hi>a part of worſhip,</hi> but <hi>humane;</hi> it has the <hi>matter,</hi> and outward <hi>form,</hi> only wanting the <hi>right effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe;</hi> it wants that which ſhould give it the ſtamp of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical and warrantable</hi> worſhip.</p>
            <p>Again, we ſee with our eyes worſhipping towards <hi>the Altar, the Eaſt,</hi> and at the ſound of the word <hi>Jeſus:</hi> and theſe things are made the Motive of worſhip, if not ſomething elſe; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>no Canon</hi> enforce theſe, but yet they are generally practiſed by all that hope to make earnings and good wages out of the Churches preferments. Now whether the Conformiſts <hi>exceed the Canons,</hi> or the Nonconformiſts <hi>fall ſhort of them,</hi> 'tis ſtill the ſame caſe, and there will be the ſame or greater difference, than if the former kept level with the Rule, and the other came ſhort of it; or the latter came up to the Rule, and the other tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it.</p>
            <p>The Doctor will tell us, <hi>That to bow at the Name of Jeſus, is
<pb facs="tcp:49933:13"/>
no more than going to Church at the Tolling of a Bell,</hi> Defence, p. 864. and is very facetious and pleaſant with his adverſary <hi>T. G.</hi> drolling about <hi>Whittingtons Bells,</hi> and <hi>Meg</hi> of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> p. 867. nor ought any man dare to check the excellent wit of theſe Repartees, only it had been wiſht he had beſtow'd a little fancy on <hi>Whittingtons Cat:</hi> but I aſſure the Doctor in many indifferent mens judgment, the Objection is not ſo eaſily dofft off; for why may not an <hi>Image</hi> give warning to <hi>the eye</hi> when to worſhip God, as well as <hi>a Bell to the Ear?</hi> 'Tis true indeed, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have preferred an Image higher, than to be <hi>Motivum Cultûs;</hi> but the queſtion is, Whether they do not ſin in applying it to this <hi>lower uſe,</hi> to make it an ordinary ſtated <hi>Motive to worſhip?</hi> If they do, how ſhall we excuſe our own Adorations? if not, why do we not introduce Images into our Churches, as well as theſe other of bowing towards the Altar, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> which if once our Church-men ſhall venture upon (as with equal reaſon they may do), they'l find them not <hi>a Bell to Toll Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Church,</hi> but thouſands of <hi>Aſſenters out of it.</hi> Beſides his Illuſtration is very lame, though witty enough; for the <hi>Bell tolls out of worſhip</hi> to Convene the people to the worſhip of God: but <hi>the ſound of the word Jeſus</hi> is uſed in <hi>the midſt,</hi> in the <hi>height,</hi> in the <hi>heat</hi> of worſhip, when the ſoul ſhould be moſt firmly, ardently intent upon its Devotion, and not ſit liſtning and watching, as <hi>Whittingtons Cat watcht the Mouſe</hi> (there 'tis for you) for the caſual ſtarting of a word, and the dropping of two ſyllables. But if it be a duty to give external reverence to God when ever the word <hi>Jeſus</hi> is named, there's more need of it in our ordinary Converſes, and the ſecular affairs of this world, when thoſe divertiſements diſtract our minds from the actual thoughts of God, which might be retrieved by this Doctrine; and ſo that <hi>word</hi> might do the ſervice of <hi>another Bell,</hi> I mean that which in Popiſh Countries goes <hi>Ting tang, ting tang,</hi> before the <hi>Hoſte,</hi> when carried to the ſick, or dying, from which all that meet it are obliged to take the hint, and fall down and worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49933:13"/>The moderation of that Canon, 1640, which recommends bowing towards the Eaſt, or Altar, is very commendable: <hi>In the practiſe or omiſſion of this Rite, we deſire the Rule of Charity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Apoſtle may be obſerved; which is, That they which uſe this Rite, deſpiſe not them who uſe it not; and they who uſe it not, condemn not thoſe that uſe it.</hi> I would gladly hear a fair Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given, why the Apoſtle ſhould <hi>preſcribe the Rule of Charity</hi> to be obſerved in this <hi>one Rite</hi> or <hi>Ceremony,</hi> more than another? why the <hi>Rule of Charity</hi> ſhould take place in bowing <hi>towards the Altar,</hi> and yet the <hi>Rule of ſeverity</hi> in the <hi>ſign of the Croſs,</hi> and <hi>kneeling at the Lords Supper?</hi> what ſolid Reaſon can they give, why they make fiſh of one, and fleſh of another: The Apoſtle <hi>preſcribes a Rule;</hi> and they will make uſe of it, when, where, and in what caſes they pleaſe; and in others where 'tis as uſeful, lay it by, like one of their vacated Canons. Is it becauſe we are bound to walk according to <hi>the Rule preſcribed by the Church?</hi> why are not they bound to walk according to <hi>the Rule preſcribed by the Apoſtle?</hi> Are we more bound <hi>to obey them,</hi> than they <hi>the Lord Chriſt,</hi> ſpeaking in and by his immediately inſpired ſervants? why could they not have relaxed the other Canons to the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this? or why not have ſcrewed up this to the inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rigour of the others? was it <hi>for peace-ſake</hi> that we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in this one? Let the ſame Motive prevail for the ſame Indulgence in the reſt! was it <hi>to ſhew their Authority,</hi> that they may bind and looſe, command what they pleaſe, and leave what they ſee good at liberty, without rendring a Reaſon, but that of their Wills? Such arbitrary power is too great an encroachment upon the freehold of Conſcience, and Soveraignty of Chriſt, and will juſtifie any Chriſtian to aſſert that liberty againſt it, wherein Chriſt has inſtated him. Was it becauſe the people had been <hi>broken by long uſe and cuſtom to the others,</hi> and therefore they would ſtruggle hard to keep the ground they had got, when this latter was but <hi>a Novice, a Candidate, a Probationer</hi> for Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which if the people would tamely bow their necks unto, they might be cramped with a more <hi>peremptory Canon</hi> when time
<pb facs="tcp:49933:14"/>
ſhould ſerve; but if they proved reſtiff and croſs-grain'd, the next Convocation might make an honourable retreat?</p>
            <p>And what if now we are ſtumbling ere we are aware upon the true Reaſon of the diverſity between the tempers of this, and ſome other Canons? However, whether theſe things be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> or merely <hi>recommended,</hi> or barely <hi>permitted,</hi> all is a caſe as to my Argument; for I find theſe things practiſed by all our leading Church-men; All the <hi>Fathers of the Church,</hi> all the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Churches</hi> are agreed; all that pretend to any hopes of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Importance,</hi> are agreed to outrun the Conſtable, and though herein they outrun one another, and all of them outrun the Diſſenters; and this is a difference in ſomething more than <hi>a circumſtance,</hi> even at leaſt in a <hi>circumſtantial part of worſhip;</hi> yet muſt we be ſuppoſed to be agreed.</p>
            <p>This laſt mention'd Canon of the Church, I hear is repealed by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> which plainly proves, that <hi>the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi> has more authority even <hi>in matters of worſhip,</hi> than the whole Church, as a Church, when moſt ſolemnly met together in the Repreſentative Church (as they call it) of <hi>a Convocation;</hi> and yet the practiſe runs with a full ſtream towards their own old Canon, as if they ſecretly gave great Deference to the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church againſt the Parliament,</hi> for the leading-practiſe of the grand Eccleſiaſticks is <hi>tantamount</hi> to a Canon, nay to a Law, to thoſe whoſe hopes and expectancies teach them a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on them; ſo that this now obſolete Canon has paſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nature of a Commandment, much like the old Statute, <hi>Ne Rectores proſternant Arbores in Goemeterio;</hi> the Tenor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of runs thus: <hi>Which thing we will not command to be done, but we will commend it when it is done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Doctor having prudently ſuppoſed <hi>one half,</hi> comes to prove <hi>the other half;</hi> and it's wiſely done to loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for asking: He argues thus: <hi>If it be lawful to ſeparate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of greater purity</hi> (ſuppoſe as before ſuppoſed) <hi>than a bare difference in opinion as to ſome circumſtantials will be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground to break Communion, and ſet up new Churches.</hi> To
<pb facs="tcp:49933:14"/>
which I anſwer, 1. by <hi>denying the conſequence;</hi> ſtrange! what deny the conſequence? what can be plainer? Where there's <hi>an agreement, a confeſſed agreement</hi> in <hi>doctrine,</hi> and <hi>the ſubſtantial parts of worſhip;</hi> what can you pretend to divide in, to ſeparate upon, but ſome <hi>ſorry circumſtances,</hi> unleſs you will make a Schiſm about Goats Wool, or Moon-ſhine in the water? But if you pleaſe, Sir, to have a little patience, I'le tell you! <hi>ſubſtantial parts of worſhip,</hi> and <hi>bare circumſtances,</hi> are not ſo <hi>immediately op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,</hi> but there lies a certain thing <hi>in the middle</hi> between them: upon which <hi>middle thing,</hi> though otherwiſe we were <hi>agreed in Doctrine, and the ſubſtantial parts of worſhip,</hi> it will be <hi>lawful to divide;</hi> I ſay it again, there is a <hi>Medium</hi> between <hi>ſubſtantial parts of worſhip,</hi> and <hi>bare circumſtances;</hi> A bare circumſtance is that which adheres to <hi>every action,</hi> as it is <hi>an action;</hi> to every <hi>natural body,</hi> as 'tis <hi>a natural body;</hi> every action, whether <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>ſacred,</hi> muſt be performed in <hi>ſome time;</hi> every body muſt be circumſcribed <hi>in ſome place;</hi> A <hi>ſubſtantial part</hi> of worſhip, is a Term of the Doctors, and his Friends making, and we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it ſhould be of their explaining; As far as I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, they mean by it either, 1. that which God has <hi>expreſly commanded;</hi> or 2. ſome <hi>notable parts of worſhip</hi> as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; or 3. that which God <hi>mainly requires,</hi> as the directing our hearts to himſelf, as the <hi>object</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of our worſhip; or 4. <hi>I cannot tell what,</hi> till they tell me: but beſides theſe two extremes, there are ſome intermediate things, which are neither <hi>natural circumſtances</hi> cleaving to the perſon that worſhippeth, nor to the Religious action it ſelf, on the one hand: nor yet on the other hand, are they commanded by God, either <hi>in genere,</hi> or <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> i. e. God has neither commanded the <hi>things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> nor are the things <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the performing <hi>thoſe things that he has commanded;</hi> nor any of <hi>their kind;</hi> nor are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <hi>in any general rule, or precept</hi> of the Goſpel: And yet it has pleaſed the Church, that is, the <hi>Epiſcopal party,</hi> to exalt theſe things to a high preferment in worſhip, to ſignifie the ſame things with the Sacramental Elements, to make them <hi>neceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:49933:15"/>
to ſalvation,</hi> as far as man can make them, that is to lay them as Conditions in the way of our enjoying the Sacraments, which, they ſay, <hi>God has made neceſſary to ſalvation;</hi> and lay the ſtreſs and weight of the <hi>Churches peace, ſafety and unity</hi> upon theſe things, tranſlated out of their proper places; and that theſe things ſo uſed, ſo applied, ſo cloathed with their preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, are ſinful, is not our bare <hi>opinion</hi> (as the Doctor wiſely phraſeth it) but our ſetled <hi>judgment,</hi> which we have, do, and ſhall maintain againſt them, when they have once lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to underſtand the Queſtion: We have therefore ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to divide upon, beſides <hi>ſubſtantial parts of worſhip and circumſtances.</hi> And now where is this conſequence, which to an intelligent and obſerving Reader, is the only ſtrength of his Sermon? But we need never fear it, the Clergy will be ſure to find us matter for quarrel and contention, or it ſhall go hard, beſides a parcel of <hi>inconſiderable circumſtances,</hi> which may be determined, but very ſorrily by thoſe that pretend moſt to the power; for he that worſt may, commonly holds the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. But 2. for further anſwer, let him go back to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Diſcourſe, where I have proved that the foundation upon which his diſcourſe is built, is weak, and therefore the whole ſuperſtructure muſt tumble upon his own head; for he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes there is <hi>an agreement in Doctrine, and the ſubſtantial parts of worſhip,</hi> which we either deny, or cannot grant till we are taught what he means by them.</p>
            <p>The Controverſie therefore ſtands upon the ſame bottom on which it has ſtood theſe hundred years, and more, like that famous <hi>ſtone in the Weſt,</hi> which they ſay, <hi>a child may ſhake,</hi> but <hi>a hundred men cannot overturn.</hi> Every wrangler can joſtle our principles, but the United force of the world cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them; <hi>True men</hi> may be killed, but <hi>Truth</hi> will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live all enmity. This argument of the Doctors has been frequently anſwered, and expoſed; but now like an old Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very new turn'd, and freſh trim'd up with a new Lace, it paſſes for a ſpruce piece of Gallantry, a brisk ſally of Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination;
<pb facs="tcp:49933:15"/>
ſo conſiderable it is, <hi>who</hi> it is that ſpeaks and writes, more than <hi>what</hi> is ſpoken or written! So have I known a ſorry Jade, which in the hands of the poor Countrey-man, would not give five Marks; when in the hands of a Gentleman, a little curried up, well managed by a nimble Jockey, and ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voucht for by one that was no ſlave to his word, fetch roundly Twenty Guineys at the hands of a youngſter that had more money than wit.</p>
            <p>What has hitherto engroſt the whole ſtrength of the Doctors <hi>Reaſon;</hi> he now comes to ſet a fine edg and gloſs upon with his Rhetorick: To ſeparate (ſays he) <hi>conſidering the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of mens fancies about theſe matters, is to make an infinite Diviſibility in Churches, without any poſſible ſtop to further Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</hi> Which is nothing but the Eccho of that Charge, which from their <hi>Roman</hi> Adverſaries has ſo long and loudly rung about their own Ears. I ſhall only ſay, That <hi>the power which he aſcribes to National Churches, conſidering the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the fancies and humours in finding out and impoſing their own Inventions, will but make burdens innumerable and intolerable, without any poſſible ſtop to further and greater vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> only let him not always miſcall <hi>Conſcience</hi> by the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous name of <hi>Fancy!</hi> The very truth is, we have no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Certainty in theſe matters; no ſuch Demonſtration, <hi>Cui non poteſt ſubeſſe falſum,</hi> which <hi>Archbiſhop Laud</hi> (and by conſequence the Doctor) requires of all Diſſenters; when yet he could find no ſuch Demonſtration for <hi>the being of a God</hi> (as I ſhall evince ere long). But ſome will <hi>ſcruple</hi> where <hi>they need not;</hi> and others to cry quit with them, will <hi>impoſe</hi> where <hi>they ought not;</hi> and thus between <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>wilfulneſs,</hi> between <hi>little knowledg</hi> and <hi>great pride,</hi> humble peaceable Chriſtians are like to have a fine time on't: But from ſome inconſiderable, and petty inconveniences, ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle trouble that ariſes to a Church from the levity and volubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mens minds, to bring in that enormous, monſtrous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, of enſlaving all mens judgments and conſciences, forcing
<pb facs="tcp:49933:16"/>
them to ſurrender their Reaſons to naked will and pleaſure, and put all that's worth owning in their Beings, into the hands of thoſe of whoſe fidelity and tenderneſs to keep and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them, they have had no better experience, and can have no good ſecurity; is a Medicine worſe than that Poyſon, even as much as 'tis better to have a Rational Soul, though ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to miſtakes, than the Soul of a Brute, which may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged as you will, with a ſtrong Bit and Bridle.</p>
            <p>Honoured Sir! you ſee how I have wearied my ſelf, to tire you, with the prolixty of this Letter; and now to refreſh you in the cloſe, I'le tell you a piece of News: The Doctor tells us, That <hi>if once the people be brought to underſtand, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe their duty as to Communion with our Churches, other diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which obſtruct our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, will be more eaſily removed.</hi> It's incredible what the various Votes of the Coffee-houſes are about thoſe words; ſome ſay, Ay! If there were <hi>no Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,</hi> there would be <hi>no Nonconformity;</hi> if there were <hi>no diſagreement,</hi> we ſhould all <hi>be agreed:</hi> others again deny it; and ſay, That though the people were <hi>brought to underſtand, and practiſe all their duty</hi> which they owe to God and man, yet the ſame difference, the ſame diſtance would continue, except it be firſt proved (which they are always <hi>coming towards,</hi> but can never find a time <hi>to come to</hi>) that it is their <hi>duty</hi> to hold entire Communion with the Pariſh-Churches: others again of the more warm tempers, aſſert, That if the people could be brought to <hi>underſtand and practiſe their duty</hi> in theſe matters, thoſe Aſſemblies would be thinner than they are; and ſome proteſt it's a moſt <hi>Meridian</hi> Truth, that if men could be brought to <hi>conform in practiſe</hi> (but there lies the cunning on't) though againſt the ſhins and conſcience, <hi>all other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties would be eaſily removed;</hi> for they that are once engaged in a practiſe (whether by ſlaviſh fears, or worldly hopes, it makes no matter) muſt ſtudy Arguments to defend their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe as well as they can, and they vouch infallible experience
<pb facs="tcp:49933:16"/>
to juſtifie their opinion; for (ſay they) throw a Dog into a River over head and ears, and if he will not take care to ſwim out, let him be drown'd.</p>
            <p>It's mighty pleaſing to me to hear the Doctor profeſs, he has <hi>endeavoured to purſue his deſign, without ſharp and provoking reflexions on the perſons of any:</hi> for though you, Sir! have noted ſeveral paſſages, as inconſiſtent with the ſincerity of this expreſſion, yet I doubt not to clear up his Integrity. You mention <hi>Page</hi> 38. where, I confeſs, the Doctor does ſay, <hi>The moſt godly among them [Diſſenters] can leaſt endure to be told of their faults.</hi> This did a little ſtartle me, but not ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me into a disbelief of his Honeſty: for though he tells us, he has not uſed <hi>provoking reflexions on the perſons of any,</hi> i. e. <hi>by name;</hi> yet he might with a good conſcience, and without contradicton to his word, make ſharp provoking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions upon the whole generation of the Diſſenters, and condemn them in the lump: And whereas you inſiſt upon't, that the expreſſion is either a <hi>ſcurrilous Sarcaſm,</hi> unbecoming a Sermon; or very <hi>unchriſtian,</hi> as preſuming to judg mens hearts; or a ridiculous piece of non-ſenſe, ſeeing they cannot be ſuppoſed the <hi>moſt godly</hi> (except they be all Villains) <hi>among them,</hi> who <hi>cannot bear reproof for their faults,</hi> which is a main part of godlineſs: yet I have this to ſay; 'Tis exceeding hard for Miniſters when they mount the Pulpit, to leave their pride and paſſion behind them in their Studies, or in the Desk: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a Sermon, except a little larded with a line or two of bitterneſs, would not have pleaſed the pallate of the Reader from the Preſs, whatever it might, ſome of the Auditors from the Pulpit: Nor muſt you, Sir! be too rigid in exacting all things to the <hi>preciſe Rule of Gods word,</hi> when the Doctor in his <hi>Sermon</hi> has propounded you <hi>another Rule</hi> than that of the word <hi>to walk by.</hi>

               <p>I Have read an elegant Oration in praiſe of a <hi>Quartane Ague;</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Extolling the incomparable virtues <hi>of the Gout;</hi> and one great wit would needs write in commendation of its only enemy, <hi>Folly,</hi> but never yet could meet with a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> in Honour of <hi>Fiſty-cuffs,</hi> and <hi>Bloody noſes.</hi> Whoever therefore ſhall employ his Pen to write, his Tongue to plead in the Cauſe of <hi>Peace and Union,</hi> is ſecure to carry the day, without controul; and may claim the Priviledge of him that is of <hi>Counſel for the King,</hi> to have the <hi>firſt and laſt word</hi> to himſelf.</p>
               <p>But many cry <hi>Hoſannah</hi> to <hi>Peace</hi> one day, who will crucifie it the next: And whilſt they ſeem with the <hi>good Angels,</hi> to proclaim <hi>Peace on Earth,</hi> yet ſome ſo far do imitate the <hi>evil ones,</hi> that they have <hi>no good will towards men.</hi> So common it is, to make a <hi>Preface for Peace</hi> to Uſher

in an <hi>Alarm to war;</hi> and Invitations to <hi>Union</hi> a fair Pretext for perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as a Reverend Divine once told his Auditors in the Pulpit, <hi>Plain dealing is a Jewel, but he that uſes it will dye a Beggar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is nothing more common than to preſs <hi>the neceſſity of Union,</hi> and yet at the ſame time to continue the <hi>neceſſary cauſes of Diviſion:</hi> which ſort of Rhetoricians might do well to conſider, that whilſt they declaim moſt paſſionately againſt the <hi>evil of Separation,</hi> they do but whip their <hi>own crimes upon other mens backs,</hi> and reproach themſelves by railing at other mens faults.

               <p>Were it lawful to be pleaſant in a caſe ſo ſad as ours is, this <hi>Author</hi> has given us the temptation and that only by <hi>Inverting</hi> his words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt <hi>perverting</hi> of the Truth: <hi>There's no impoſſibility, nor conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable difficulty to Retrieve the univerſal Peace of the Chriſtian world, if all men were ſuch Chriſtians as they ought to be;</hi> (which I dare engage for them they never will) <hi>but till mens Lordly pride be ſubdued to a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree than the world has yet found it, 'tis in vain ao expect this ſtate of peace and tranquility in the Church. Nor ſhall we need to go far,</hi> (not a ſtep) <hi>from home, for a ſufficient evidence of this; for though our differences</hi> are ſuch, <hi>as the wiſer Proteſtants abroad, not only condemn, but wonder at,</hi> (and the Proteſtants at home ſmart under the effects of them) <hi>yet has it puzzled the wiſest perſons among us, to compoſe them;</hi> becauſe they that preſume themſelves to be, and really ſhould have been ſo, have more ſtudied to bring in the <hi>cauſes,</hi> than to remove the <hi>conſequences</hi> of our troubles: But the moſt ſurprizing thing in all the Doctors preamble, is his ſad complaint, that <hi>neither the miſeries we have felt, nor the calamities we fear, nor the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgments of God upon us, nor the unexpected deliverances vouchſafed to us, nor the common danger we are yet in, have abated mens h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall then begin to believe that man is afraid of a Paroxyſme of the Gout, who will retrench his intemperance to prevent it; and will then ſuppoſe them real and ſincere in complaining of what they feel, or fear, when they will forbear, or do, at leaſt ſome very little thing, to remove the one, and obviate the other: But <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> even in a <hi>Dungeon</hi> is too ſweet a morſel to be ſpit up again, unleſs God gives a ſtrong vomit; A prelatical ſpirit will be perſecuting when in exile at <hi>Frankfurt;</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> thought it worthy their ambition, to vex the <hi>Seculars,</hi> even in <hi>Wisbich Caſtle.</hi>

                  <hi>Peace</hi> then (without bringing in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> for a voucher) <hi>is a good thing,</hi> yes, <hi>a very good thing</hi> it is, if we could catch it; but thus have I ſeen one ſport with his Dog, ſhewing him a cruſt, which when the poor Cur has zealouſly jumpt to reach, he holds it up higher, and never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends him one ſnap of it.</p>

That is, <hi>When once the bloody ſhambles of Tyrants by God's Providence were ſhut up, and welcome Peace began to ſhine upon the late clouded Churches, they wiſely fell to work with exterior things, and buſied themſelves about Religious Rites, Ceremonies, Ornaments; about matters of Order, and Subordination; about the Degrees of Miniſters, their outward Splendor, the power and efficacy of Church-Diſcipline; about Laws, Canons, and Eccleſiaſtical Government; about the Union, and Combination of Churches; about the exalting ſome in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence above others, and ſubjection of the poorer to the greater and richer; about maintaining Uniformity, and preventing Schiſms. And this part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Church happily effected; and when they ſhould have proceeded to the other of Reformation, a diſmal hurricane, by the irruption of the Northern, and barbarous Nations, overſpread the face of the Church with Egyptian darkneſs, that it was ſome Ages before ſhe could recover her former bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ſad Fate that commonly attends great and general Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances; Churchmen are <hi>cumber'd with many things,</hi> and neglect <hi>the one thing neceſſary;</hi> and inſtead of reducing Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line to their Original Integrity, to what they were <hi>in the beginning,</hi> are otherwiſe employ'd about ſetling Liturgies, re-inforcing Ceremonies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting Uniformity, advancing their own Dignity, till God, in righteous judgment, removes from them the opportunities of <hi>acting for themſelves,</hi> who ſlighted thoſe inviting junctures wherein they <hi>might have ſerved their God.</hi> And moſt men have noted, that within theſe twenty years Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence offer'd them <hi>three ſeaſons,</hi> wherein with great eaſe, they might have healed our Breaches; the firſt, after His Majeſties happy Reſtauration; the ſecond, after the Plague, Fire, and War; the third, after the Diſcovery of the late Horrid and Popiſh Plot: but yet it pleaſed not God to give them, with the opportunities, to ſee the things that belong'd to our Peace.</p>
               <p>We ſee then Peace is a Commodity everywhere expoſed to view: They complain <hi>that we cheapen it, but will not buy:</hi> And indeed we would not out-bid our Purſes, nor <hi>buy Gold too dear.</hi> We complain that they offer it, but at ſuch unreaſonable Rates, that we cannot reach it; but ſo have many done, that have got rich Goods in their hands, ſet 'em too high, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a good Market, and at laſt, perhaps, may be glad to put 'em off for an old Song.</p>

               <p>THE Reverend Author, having ſet himſelf this great Task, to prove <hi>Conformity lawful,</hi> the preſent <hi>Separation ſinful,</hi> has choſen the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.16. a little varied from the Original, and ſomething from our own Verſion, that by that diſguiſe it might better comply with, and ſubſerve his great deſign.</p>
               <q>Nevertheleſs whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule, let us mind the ſame things.</q>
               <p>A <hi>Text,</hi> from which of all in the whole Bible, Diſſenters leaſt expected their Conviction; for who could have believed that the Apoſtle, who, in <hi>ver.</hi> 15. leaves the <hi>otherwiſe minded,</hi> to <hi>God's inſtruction;</hi> ſhould, in the next <hi>verſe,</hi> aſſert the Churches power to make Impoſitions to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; that he ſhould blow cold and hot with one and the ſame breath; and mount an Eccleſiaſtical Canon, upon a Platform of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>I cannot conjecture what ſhould ever flatter them, that this Text would become their Proſelyte, except it be one of theſe two things, or both:</p>

               <p>Theſe things would have continued exceeding plain, had not ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Reaſons, neceſſitated men to render them perplexed and obſcure; which how the Author of this Sermon will be able to do, we muſt now attend.</p>
               <p n="1">[1] The firſt ſtep the Doctor takes, to make the words his own, is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49933:21"/>
this: <hi>We are</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to conſider, that an</hi> unhappy Schiſm, <hi>or</hi> wilful Breach <hi>of the Churches Unity, had begun in the Apoſtles times:</hi> there did ſo, and we have <hi>conſider'd</hi> it, and do find two things conſiderable. 1. That <hi>a Schiſm,</hi> and <hi>a wilful Breach,</hi> are terms equivalent; where there is <hi>no wilful Breach</hi> of Peace, there's <hi>no Schiſm.</hi> To <hi>be turn'd out of the Church</hi> againſt my will, and beſides my deſerts is none of my Schiſm; to <hi>be kept out of the Church,</hi> by the old turn-pikes of ſinful conditions, is none of my Schiſm; <hi>Wilful Obſtinacy,</hi> is the formal reaſon of Heretical Pravity, and Schiſmatical Levity. <hi>Errare poſſum, haereticus eſſe volo:</hi> Invincible Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may betray me to miſtakes, but I can chuſe whether I will be an Heretick or no: ſo may I poſſibly ſeparate, and judge I have juſt reaſon ſo to do; yet will I not be a Schiſmatick, nor ſhall they, with all the skill they have, make me one; for I will ſtill maintain a Chriſtian frame of ſpirit towards thoſe from whom I am forced to ſeparate, and ſeparate no further than I am forced. 2. The <hi>Reaſon of that primitive Schiſm,</hi> is more conſiderable, which (as the Doctor informs us) <hi>was upon a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that aroſe concerning the neceſſity of keeping the law of</hi> Moſes; <hi>and that which made the Schiſm more dangerous, was, that the beginners of it pretended a Commiſſion from the Apoſtles.</hi> Let now the Reader believe me, I did verily believe it would come to this at laſt; That all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of Diviſions and Separations, would firſt be impoſing unneceſſary, doubtful, unſcriptural terms of Communion, and then to ſet a good face upon a bad matter, would pretend Catholick, Apoſtolick Traditions, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, Decretals, Extravagants, Canons, Conſtitutions, to juſtifie their own Uſurpations; and when once they are got into the Saddle, and have the whip-hand of the poor Laity, all that cannot run like Tumblers through theſe Hoops, ſhall be rated as Schiſmaticks: Now becauſe the Doctor has a little diſguis'd the matter in his Diſcourſe, to make it ſmile upon his pretenſions, I will give the Reader the naked truth of the whole buſineſs.</p>
               <p>There were in the Apoſtles days ſome Judaizing Chriſtians, who being not well weaned from the Moſaic Ceremonies, would needs compel the Gentile Converts to their old obſervances, for which they plauſibly preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thoſe Rites having been once confeſſedly eſtabliſh'd by Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and not yet explicitely repealed by any Countermand of Chriſt, equal to that whereby they had been enjoined, were ſtill in full force, power, ſtrength and virtue, and did oblige the gentil world to give their aſſent and conſent to them; and in purſuance of this impoſing humor, they would have obtruded upon them a Canon, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.5. That <hi>except they were circumciſed, and obſerv'd the law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>they could not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49933:21"/>
To this Uſurpation the Apoſtles oppoſe their authority, and taking the Gentile Chriſtians into their protection, vindicate their Liberty, and command them <hi>to ſtand faſt in it,</hi> and not tamely ſurrender themſelves to the will and pleaſures of theſe imperious Maſters: And becauſe St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by his compliance, had hardened theſe Judaizers in their Superſtitions, St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes him up roundly, <hi>reproves him to his face,</hi> and ſtrenuouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts their Goſpel Liberty; which had he not done, the Doctor thinks, <hi>all the Gentile Chriſtians had been forced either to a compliance with the Jews, or to a perpetual Schiſm:</hi> But herein I muſt beg his pardon; for though they had been forced to a <hi>Separation,</hi> it had been no <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which viſibly had lain on the other ſide; for <hi>Paul</hi> in his admonition to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> lays all the blame of the Separation not upon them that ſeparate, but on thoſe that gave cauſe to the Separation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. <hi>I beſeech you, Brethren, mark them which cauſe diviſions and offences among you, and avoid them.</hi> Where he points to us theſe three things. 1. That they who <hi>cauſe diviſions,</hi> are the <hi>culpable dividers:</hi> the Impoſers muſt be reſponſible for the evil conſequences of their Impoſitions. 2. That it's <hi>lawful,</hi> nay a duty, <hi>to divide from thoſe,</hi> that unwarrantably give ſuch cauſe of diviſion; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> decline, or depart from them. 3. That any Condition of Communion impoſed <hi>beſides,</hi> as well as <hi>againſt</hi> the Doctrine <hi>received from the Apoſtles,</hi> is a ſufficient ground to condemn the Impoſers, to juſtifie thoſe that reject ſuch conditions; for ſo we read, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> And ſo we find it rendered, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Though we, or an Angel from heaven preach</hi> any other Goſpel <hi>unto you, then that we have preach'd unto you,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto matters do not work to the Doctor's mind; he does <hi>movere,</hi> but <hi>nihil promovere;</hi> the ſtep he has taken, has ſet his cauſe a ſtep back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</p>
               <p n="2">[2] And therefore he will try another Experiment, whether the Epiſtle with the Context may not invite, or draw the Text to his Intereſt.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) His firſt approach he makes thus: <hi>The Apoſtle exhorts the</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians <hi>to an unanimous and conſtant reſolution in holding faſt to the faith of the Goſpel, in ſpight of all the malice and threats of their enemies,</hi> Phil. 1.27, 28. And moſt wholſom counſel it is, God give all Diſſenters grace to take it; for <hi>if once the fears of Troubles and Perſecutions, make men afraid to own and maintain their Religion, it will be an eaſie matter for their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies first to divide, and then to ſubdue them.</hi> This will not yet do the Doctor's work, nor undo the Diſſenters.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) He makes a nearer approach, thus: The Apoſtle <hi>beſeeches them,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49933:22"/>
in the moſt vehement and affectionate manner, not to give way to any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences or diviſions among them.</hi> Very good! <hi>As much</hi> then <hi>as in us lies, we will live peaceably with all men:</hi> But what ſecurity ſhall we have that they will do ſo with us? We will labor that there be no differences in judgment, (which yet in our imperfect ſtate is not to be expected) but if there be <hi>differences,</hi> we will take care there be no <hi>diviſions;</hi> for we are taught to maintain Chriſtian affections towards thoſe that are of <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent apprehenſions</hi> from our ſelves, and <hi>different practices</hi> too, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to thoſe different ſentiments; for ſo the Apoſtle adjures the Church, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>To be like minded, having the ſame love, being of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and of one mind.</hi> Upon which words the Doctor gives us this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, q. d. <hi>I have ſeen the miſerable effects of Diviſions in other Churches,</hi> (indeed <hi>Diviſions,</hi> that are <hi>cauſed by,</hi> or <hi>iſſue out in,</hi> hatred, malice, envy, perſecution, have effects as miſerable as themſelves, but what miſerable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects did he, or we ever ſee, that all mens faces were not of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion?) <hi>Let me therefore entreat you—to avoid the firſt tendencies to any breaches among you;</hi> (and unneceſſary Impoſitions lay the firſt foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to theſe Miſchiefs:) <hi>entertain no jealouſies, no unjust ſuſpicions of each other,</hi> (as that the moſt godly among thoſe that differ from you in leſſer matters, can leaſt endure to be told of their faults; or that the tenderneſs of their minds, out of meer ſhame-facedneſs, keeps them from declaring truth:) but <hi>ſhew all the kindneſs you are able to your fellow members,</hi> (and ſurely you are able to wave theſe Bones of Contention, theſe make-bate Ceremonies; you are able to forbear railing, perſecuting, are you not?) I confeſs Pride is an impotency of mind, and Paſſion a great weakneſs of ſoul; the ſtrongeſt wills have commonly the weakeſt reaſon to govern them; and the ambition <hi>of glorying in the fleſh</hi> of thoſe whom they can make to truckle to their Humors, and Crotchets, is a pretty fleſh-pleaſing vanity, which I hope in time you will overcome; ſo that hitherto we can ſmell no Plot the Doctor has upon us, no ſcent of Match or Powder; or how by theſe Ambages, and remote Fetches he intends to attack us, we diſcern not.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) In the next place therefore he tells us, the Apoſtle <hi>gives Cautions againſt ſome perſons, from whom their greatest danger was,</hi> viz. <hi>ſuch as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a mighty zeal for the Law.</hi> Nay, I always ſuſpected our danger would come from that Quarter! but am glad we know our enemies, and do promiſe him, we'll keep a ſpecial eye upon them in all their motions. Some ſuch there are in the world, who are exceeding zealous for Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Traditions, and would triumph, if they could carry it, for <hi>Bel, and the Dragon:</hi> ſuch as would knead the world into its old maſs and lump,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49933:22"/>
rather than want of their wills; and as the Judaizers would renounce Chriſtianity, and return to <hi>Moſes,</hi> except the Gentiles would conform to their legal obſervances; ſo have we ſome ſuch who will revolt to <hi>Rome,</hi> unleſs they may (not retain, for who hinders them? but) impoſe their own admired knick-knacks upon others. Now ſuch as theſe the Apoſtle deals ſmartly with; he calls them <hi>Dogs, Evil Workers, the Conciſion:</hi> becauſe they tore in pieces the ſeamleſs Coat of Chriſt, into ſhreds and tatters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the minds of peaceable Chriſtians, who would willingly have united upon thoſe plain, eaſie, reaſonable terms upon which they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received, and profeſſed Chriſtianity, only theſe peeviſh trouble-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes would not let them. And this is remarkable, that the Apoſtle never gave one hard word to the Conſcientious Diſſenter, nor one good word to the Judaizing Impoſer, in all his Epiſtles.</p>
               <p>To what end now is all this pompous, ceremonious train of words? to what end are theſe Poſitions, Suppoſitions, and Preliminaries? why ſo many Lines, Entrenchments, Galleries? why theſe tedious Approaches? why all this Spaniſh Gravity? why does he not fall aboard with his Text, and ſtorm it? Alas! Things are not yet ripe, and ready for ſuch hot ſervice, and therefore—</p>
               <p n="4">(4) —The Apoſtle <hi>having done this, he perſuades all good Chriſtians to do as he did,</hi> ver. 15. <hi>Let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded;</hi> What was that? to aſſert his liberty? he <hi>did ſo,</hi> and would <hi>not be brought under the power</hi> even of <hi>lawful</hi> things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12.

Hitherto we have felt no wound, but like the bird in the tree looking at the gunner, wonders what he's fidling about, till of a ſudden ſhe's paſt feeling: At laſt the Author comes nearer: <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and differences as to opinion and practice might happen among them, he therefore lays down two Rules to govern themſelves by;</hi> Here now the Dr. beats up, and gets within our Quarters, and very ſubtilly would inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, to the unwary Reader, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gave two Rules about one and the ſame thing, whenas 'tis evident he gave but one, nor was it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he ſhould give more in that caſe: The caſe which the Dr. ſuppoſes, is that there were <hi>differences of opinion and practice</hi> among the <hi>Philippians:</hi> Let it be ſuppoſed! Does the Apoſtle give <hi>two Rules</hi> in that caſe? No! but <hi>one ſingle Rule,</hi> which was the Rule of <hi>mutual forbearance, and leaving one another to Gods Inſtructions:</hi> but in <hi>Another Caſe,</hi> where Chriſtians had <hi>attained</hi> to be of the <hi>like mind,</hi> there the Rule was, that they ſhould <hi>walk up</hi> and according to <hi>what they had attained:</hi> But we muſt go through now we are in, and therefore let us hear what theſe <hi>two Rules</hi> are, and what <hi>uſe</hi> he will make of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Rule. If any</hi> happen'd <hi>to differ from</hi> the body of Chriſtians they lived with, <hi>they ſhould do it with modeſty, and humility: not breaking out into facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Diviſions, but waiting for further information:</hi> Now here we want that Accuracy, that might have been expected from a perſon of his Abilities: For, 1. He puts it as a <hi>rare and extraordinary Caſe,</hi> [If any happen] ſuch a one as might fall out in an Age, or ſo, whereas this was a moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Caſe, and that which the Apoſtle met with everywhere, that there was <hi>a difference of apprehenſions</hi> about the leſſer things at leaſt, of Religion; nor was he to ſeek what direction to give in the caſe, but uniformly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines, that they ſhould <hi>not judge, nor deſpiſe</hi> each other upon theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49933:23"/>
nor was there ever any Church at any time wherein theſe differences did not <hi>happen:</hi> 2. He lays the ſtreſs of the duty upon thoſe that <hi>differ from the Body of the Chriſtians they live with:</hi> It is very true, the Church, or <hi>Body of Chriſtians</hi> at <hi>Philippi,</hi> at that time, was ſound in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, evangelical in their worſhip, and regular in government and Diſcipline; and therefore it was the duty of thoſe that differed from that <hi>body,</hi> not to ſeparate from it; but ſuppoſe any <hi>happened to differ from the</hi> body of Chriſtians they <hi>lived with,</hi> which were not ſo; muſt the Rule hold <hi>equally?</hi> is there the ſame obligation in the caſe alſo? what if a Chriſtian ſhould happen to live at <hi>Rome?</hi> what if it ſhould be the Drs. lot to live there? muſt he be under the ſame obligation <hi>not to divide from the body?</hi> 3. He ſuppoſes the Rule only to be given to the perſon that <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to differ from the body</hi> of the Church, whereas the Rule is mainly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Church, how they are to demean themſelves toward a diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brother, <hi>viz.</hi> to wait till God ſhall reveal his mind to the perſon other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded: Neither is he to act, nor the Church to compel, till God clear it up to his Conſcience, that he may act like a <hi>Saint,</hi> or, ſince <hi>Saints</hi> is a term of reproach, at leaſt like a <hi>Man,</hi> and not a Beaſt: 4. He diſguiſes his rule, by thoſe <hi>Terms of Art,</hi> faction, ſeparation, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> whereas <hi>faction</hi> and <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> are two things, the one always ſinful, the other many times a duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Rule.</hi> For thoſe that are come to a firmneſs, and ſettlement upon the Chriſtian Principles, he charges them by all means to preſerve Unity, and Peace among themſelves. Now theſe things alſo are laid down with as much obſcurity as one could wiſh: For, 1. Is it not the duty of thoſe who are not <hi>arrived at that firmneſs and ſettlement of judgment,</hi> to preſerve Unity and Peace? without queſtion! only this will handſomly miſlead us to a miſtake that Unity and Peace among Chriſtians are unattainable till they are all of one ſcantling in Opinion; for this is the fancy that is gotten into mens heads, That we muſt have peace with all, that in order to Peace there muſt be Unity of judgment, and uniformity in practice. 2. He ſays the Apoſtle <hi>charges them by all means to preſerve Unity,</hi> which if we underſtand of <hi>Gods means</hi> is very true; but we are not to uſe our own means, ſuch as a naughty heart would prompt to us; not to proſtitute our Reaſons and Conſciences to the luſt of men, but if it be poſſible, as much as in us lies, to live in Unity and Peace.</p>
               <p>The Text I ſee is exceedingly unwilling to be dragg'd into the Doctor's ſervice, two or three plucks therefore he will try more, and if it will not come, leave it as incorrigible, and untractable: for (ſays he) the Apoſtle ſuppoſes two things.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>The neceſſity of one fixed, certain Rule, notwithſtanding the different at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49933:24"/>
among Chriſtians:</hi> This the Dr. calls one of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but 'tis certainly one <hi>of his own ſuppoſals:</hi> For, 1. We are even now told of <hi>two Rules?</hi> one for them that <hi>differ from the body of Chriſtians they lived with;</hi> and here the Rule was, to <hi>leave them to Gods immediate Care for farther illumination;</hi> but now there is but one <hi>fixed, ſtanding Rule,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>different attainments of Chriſtians:</hi> 2. And to what end is there a <hi>fixed Rule,</hi> inflexible, and untreatable; when diſſatisfaction of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence about theſe matters will exempt any man from it? or to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe had we a Rule for Indulgence, if now it muſt be vacated by this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and fixed Rule? 3. If there be ſuch a neceſſity of a fixed ſtanding Rule, notwithſtanding mens different attainments; It's a wonder the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that contains all things neceſſary, ſhould not ſpeak of it, neither of the matter of this Rule; nor the makers of the Rule, nor the Rules by which the Rule muſt be made. 4. And if there muſt be one fixed Rule, then perhaps <hi>The particular forms of Church-government</hi> may in time prove <hi>jure Divino.</hi> 5. And what are we the nearer to ſatisfaction to be told of a Rule, and not to be told alſo what that Rule is: If a Scripture Rule, we agree, but that will not ſerve his turn; if a Rule ſent down by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that would do his work, but that we want evidence, it was intended by the Apoſtle: If Chriſt or his Apoſtles had made the Rule, with what ſecurity of Conſcience, with what ſatisfaction of mind could we acquieſce in it? but if it be a rule made by the Church governours of after times to hamper, and ſnickle all that they can get within their clutches, it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the caſe, and we ſee no reaſon to give that ſubjection to it. 6. If there be a neceſſity of one fixed Rule about things in their own natures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, then when thoſe things by their particular Circumſtances, are reduced <hi>ad actum exercitum,</hi> what muſt the poor Chriſtian do? If the Rule commands him to <hi>Act,</hi> and the Circumſtances have made the Act ſinful in <hi>that time, place,</hi> &amp;c. where is he now? here's a rule againſt his act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, here's another made by men for his acting; they might as well have made one Rule more, and that is to hang 'em out of the way, rather than to leave them to be tormented between two contrary Rules. 7. If there be a neceſſity of one fixed Rule in circumſtantial matters, how comes it to paſs, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> has determined that ſhe has power to alter and varie theſe Rules according as ſhe ſees cauſe. And, 8. Muſt this Rule be for the <hi>Univerſal Church,</hi> or a <hi>National Church,</hi> or a <hi>Particular Church?</hi> If for the <hi>Univerſal Church,</hi> it croſſes the judgment of your <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church;</hi> which ſays it is not neceſſary that <hi>Rites and Ceremonies be alike:</hi> If for a <hi>National Church,</hi> it muſt be proved that ever the Apoſtle under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood any ſuch Creature: If for a <hi>Particular Church</hi> only, then what
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49933:24"/>
will become of <hi>Uniformity</hi> in the face of the <hi>National Church,</hi> which is the great thing for which this Rule is pretended uſeful and neceſſary. 9. If there be <hi>a neceſſity of one fixed ſtanding Rule, notwithſtanding differing attainments;</hi> then either this fixed Rule muſt yield and bend to thoſe weak ones that have not attained to ſee the lawfulneſs of it, or thoſe weak ones muſt be ſtretch'd and ſcrew'd up to the fixed Rule: If the <hi>former,</hi> how is it <hi>fixed</hi> that in thouſands of Caſes, every day muſt <hi>bend?</hi> If the <hi>latter,</hi> what is become of the <hi>other Rule,</hi> that allows thoſe that have <hi>not attained, to ſtand or fall to their own Maſter,</hi> and appoints them to be <hi>left to God's gracious inſtruction?</hi> For, 10. The Rule preſcribed by the Apoſtle, <hi>If any man be otherwiſe minded, is the only fixed Rule in matters of indifferent nature;</hi> which Rule is plain Nonſenſe, if there muſt be another Rule, to which all Chriſtians muſt come up, notwithſtanding their diſſatisfactions about it. 11. That which exceedingly prejudices the Doctor's Rule, is, that the univerſal current and ſtream of all Expoſitors run againſt him. <hi>Grotius</hi> thus gloſſes it; <hi>Etiam qui de Ritibus aliter ſentiunt, interim ſciant Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelii praecepta, quae Divina eſſe perſuaſi ſunt ſibi eſſe ſequenda:</hi> i. e. <hi>They that differ in their judgments about Rituals, must yet know, that they are obliged to walk according to the Precepts of the Goſpel, which they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to be of Divine Authority.</hi> So that the Rule of Scripture was that alone to which they were obliged, who were not ſatisfied about Rites and Ceremonies. So Tirinus, <hi>Regulam hic intelligit à Chriſto &amp; Apoſtolis ejus praeſcriptam;</hi> He underſtands the Rule preſcribed by Chriſt, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. <hi>Zanchy</hi> takes it for the <hi>Rule of Brotherly Love and Holineſs;</hi> and, in a word, all conſpire againſt the Doctor's interpretation. 12. And why could not the Apoſtle have ſpoken intelligibly? had he pretended any ſuch thing, it had been eaſie to have ſaid, Notwithſtanding what I ſaid juſt now of leaving thoſe that have not attained ſo far as you and I to God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, yet my will is, that you all walk by one fixed and ſtanding Rule, whether you have attained or no, 'tis no great matter; I'll not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge theſe peeviſh tender Conſciences, Let 'em Conform, or the Prelates and their Chancellors ſhall <hi>admoniſh them, admoniſh them, admoniſh them,</hi> thrice with one breath, and then Excommunicate, and deliver them up to the Devil. To conclude, the Doctor had much better have employed his Talents in demonſtrating, 1. That by a Rule, is meant a fixed Rule about things indifferent, or dubious. 2. That the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Clergy in Convocation, Synod, or Council, muſt be the fixers of this Rule. 3. That all are bound, notwithſtanding their various meaſures of light, to conform to this Rule. 4. That the Governors of one Church, or many Churches, may make Rules for other Churches, and force them
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49933:25"/>
upon their Conſciences to be obſerved by Divine Right; inſtead of which, and much more he has to do; he has ſuppoſed, what he can never demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
               <p>But that we ſhall ſoon ſee, for now he draws apace towards Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He tells us, That <hi>the phraſe,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſeems to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the former alluſion to</hi> a Race: <hi>for the firſt thing the Greeks were wont to do as to their Exerciſes, was to circumſcribe the bounds wherein they were to be performed;</hi> now <hi>that which fixed and determined thoſe limits, was called</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>by the Greeks,</hi> &amp;c. Had it not been for theſe <hi>Olympic,</hi> and other Games and Exerciſes, I cannot tell what our modern Criticks would have done for work; but what does <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> allude to? is that term alſo applied to <hi>a Race?</hi> No! it's borrowed from the <hi>grave march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Army,</hi> not the <hi>furious running</hi> of <hi>a Foot-match:</hi> 'Tis <hi>verbum militare,</hi> a term of Art in the Tactics, ſayes <hi>Zanchy.</hi> But grant that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, (for I'll yield as much as reaſonably he can deſire for peace-ſake,) ſtill the Queſtion will recur, what that Rule is, by which we muſt either <hi>ſoberly walk,</hi> or ſwiftly run? And there are two things that chiefly ſtand in competition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A Rule of Charity,</hi> and mutual forbearance under different practices ſuitable to their different judgments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A Rule of Severity,</hi> which determines to one uniform practice, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the diverſity of judgment, ſo that all muſt be drawn, hang'd, and quarter'd, that come not up to this Rule: 'Tis the latter, the Doctor now ſo ſtifly contends for; and none can blame him if he be for that Rule, becauſe ſuch a Rule would be for him, if he could get it, which is the beſt Reaſon he can produce for this Rule.</p>
               <p n="2">II. He pleads, therefore <hi>it cannot be the</hi> Rule of Charity, <hi>becauſe the Apoſtle had ſpoken to that just before;</hi> but rather (think I) it muſt be that ſame Rule, <hi>becauſe the Apoſtle had ſpoken of it just before,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he calls it <hi>the ſame Rule,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, that very Rule he had juſt before mention'd; for they that have attained to the higheſt meaſure of knowledge, are not exempted from the Rule of Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that have leſs knowledge; and it's new Grammar, (as well as new Divinity) that a <hi>Relative</hi> cannot agree with his <hi>Antecedent,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Antecedent <hi>went before;</hi> and will deſtroy the ſureſt way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting Scripture from the Coherence and Context, if we muſt conceive
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49933:25"/>
there can be no reference of what follows after, to that which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately went before.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Doctor yet argues farther, That <hi>the Philippians underſtood already what Rules he had given them, when a Church was first formed among them, and therefore when he mentions a Rule, without declaring what it was, we have reaſon to believe it was ſuch a Rule which they well knew he had given them before.</hi> Well then, 'tis confeſſed that the Rule the Apoſtle exhorts them to walk by, was ſuch a Rule as he had before given them; we are aſſured he had given them a Rule concerning all neceſſary things; we are not aſſured he had given them any Rules for unneceſſary things: if the Doctor can, let him produce the Rule, and we are ready to Conform to it. Apocryphal Rules about new Rites, new Ceremonies, new Churches, new Government, we find none, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be contented with what he had given them before, <hi>viz.</hi> that Rule by which the New Creature is guided and governed. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>As many as walk according to this Rule, peace be on them.</hi> But we have got <hi>another Rule,</hi> and they that walk not according <hi>to that Rule,</hi> though conſcientiouſly and ſtrictly walking by <hi>the other, no peace ſhall be on them, no peace ſhall be with them,</hi> but wrath and vengeance, Fire and Fagot; but that time is ſhort.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Doctor yet further argues from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34. <hi>The reſt will I ſet in order when I come.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.17. <hi>As God hath diſtributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, ſo let him walk, and ſo ordain I in all the Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then we have an Order, an Act or an Ordinance of the Apoſtle, a fixt ſtanding Rule, to which all are bound to Conform themſelves; but what now if they who call themſelves the Apoſtles Succeſſors, will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to Conform to the Rule? The Apoſtles Rule is, <hi>Let every one walk as God has diſtributed to him.</hi> The modern Rule is, <hi>Let every one walk farther and faſter than God has diſtributed to him.</hi> Well, there's no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for, (ſayes the Doctor) <hi>This ſhews the Apoſtles did not leave all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to act as they judg'd fit;</hi> No, I believe they did not, but as God by his Apoſtles <hi>thought fit;</hi> not by Traditions, but Scripture Revelations; not by the Fleſh, but by the Spirit; not by their own Wills, or the Wills of men, but by and after the Will of God. But <hi>the Apoſtles made Rules determining their practice:</hi> No doubt of that; but was it about <hi>Mint, Aniſe, and Cummin,</hi> or the <hi>great and weighty things of the Law?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49933:26"/>V. Still he proceeds; That although <hi>Men might pretend that the things were not in themſelves neceſſary,</hi> that they <hi>were ſcrupled by ſome perſons, and therefore were not fit to be impoſed upon any, yet he does not find that the Apoſtles forbore to give Rules in ſuch caſes, and to oblige Chriſtians to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them.</hi> To which I ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That I do not find that the Apoſtles did attempt to give Rules in ſuch Caſes, other than the Rule of Charity, of kindneſs, of mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing one another; the Doctor does not find they did forbear. Muſt we believe they <hi>did every thing,</hi> we <hi>do not find they did forbear?</hi> Really I do not find they did forbear preaching againſt Liturgies, the Sign of the Croſs, Archbiſhops and Biſhops, Archdeacons, and Deans; will he allow me to conclude, that therefore he did preach againſt them? what wild work would an Argument from Authority negatively in matters of Fact make with our Ceremonies? And what a Hubbub had it raiſed, if ſuch Reaſonings were to be found in the Sermons of the Diſſenters?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let him therefore ſhew plainly, That the Apoſtles interpoſed their Authority, to impoſe upon the Diſciples any one thing, which was not antecedently, ſome way or other, neceſſary to that Impoſition; and never ſtand caſting a miſt before our eyes, by ſaying the Apoſtles <hi>gave Rules in ſuch Caſes,</hi> when the Caſes are vaſtly different from thoſe that are in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate amongſt us.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. He goes on, What the Apoſtle thus impoſed, <hi>was not on the meer authority of Apoſtles, but as Church-Governors, whoſe buſineſs it is to take care of their preſervation.</hi> Not as Apoſtles, but as Governors! Things well joined, but ill divided! <hi>As they</hi> were Apoſtles, <hi>ſo were they</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of Churches, to whom <hi>the Care of all the Churches</hi> was committed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. There was indeed another matter that ſhould have here been ſhuffled in, and is handſomly inſinuated, That the Apoſtles in eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing Rules for Rites and Ceremonies, and thoſe other things that are ſuppoſed, acted not as extraordinary Officers, whoſe power was to expire with their perſons, but as ordinary Guides, who were to have Succeſſors in their whole Ruling work to the end of the World; but this is far more eaſily hinted, than proved: we deny therefore, and wait for evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Apoſtles ever made Rules for the determining of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Circumſtances, and impoſed them on the Churches as terms of Communion.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49933:26"/>2. That Dioceſan Biſhops, or Metropolitans, are the Apoſtles Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in the governing of Churches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That if they did ſucceed them in any part of their office and worke, yet that they have the ſame fulneſs of power, as wanting their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible direction, wiſdom, prudence, and other qualifications that might either move Chriſt to entruſt them with that power, or perſuade Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to ſubmit to their power.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. To ſweeten, and ſet off the Diſcourſe, the Doctor has formed a moſt ingenious compariſon between the power and skill of a General of an Army to command, and the Duty which private Soldiers owe to their General on the one part, and the Authority, Wiſdom and Conduct of Church-Governors, to order the Eccleſiaſtical Militia, and the Duty that private Chriſtians owe to their Orders on the other hand, which would have taken before the Trained Bands, or the Artillery Company; at preſent let it paſs for as much as 'tis worth, that is, a ſpecimen of wit, and a rare piece of ingenuity.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. But his great Refuge, his ſafe Retreat, is in and to the <hi>Council at Jeruſalem,</hi> concerning which, the Reverend Author expreſſes himſelf thus: <hi>Although there were many doubts and ſcruples in their times about ſeveral Rites and Cuſtoms, yet the Apoſtles did give Rules in ſuch Caſes, and bind Chriſtians to obſerve them, as we find in that famous Decree made upon great deliberation in the Council of the Apoſtles at</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>To which it were enough to ſay, That the Apoſtles did give Rules, but not ſuch as are now given: They gave Rules in the Caſe that lay before them, but that Caſe was nothing akin to thoſe Caſes which are now before us; That in what Caſe ſoever the Apoſtles did give Rules, it's nothing to them, who pretend a power to give Rules to us, except they can ſhew a Commiſſion as fairly drawn and ſealed as the Apoſtles could produce for their Determinations: But yet more particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Decree of the Apoſtles was about things neceſſary, antecedent to the Decree; not neceſſary becauſe decreed onely, but therefore decreed becauſe neceſſary. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burthen than theſe neceſſary things.</hi> How far is the ſpirit and temper of modern Impoſers from that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who think good to impoſe upon us the inſupportable burthen of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary things!</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Council had the infallible guidance and ſuperintendency of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49933:27"/>
                  <hi>the Holy Spirit,</hi> (which is not inconſiſtent with the moſt ſerious delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us.</hi> But no National Church ever had any promiſe, and therefore cannot in Faith pray for, or expect ſuch immediate aſſiſtance, ſuch extraordinary direction. Let no Church aſſume equal power to impoſe, without an equal Commiſſion for ſuch power.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The private Chriſtians might reaſonably acquieſce in the Decree, becauſe it had their own conſent, antecedent to its making: A wonderful inſtance, and not to be parallel'd in latter Ages: <hi>There,</hi> the Holy Spirits authority, and the Churches conſent, go together; but <hi>here,</hi> we have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: That burden will ſit the eaſier on our backs, which firſt has the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of our hearts; and ſuch was that Decree, not only ſent <hi>to the Brethren,</hi> ver. 23. but <hi>by and from the Brethren. The Apoſtles and Elders, and Brethren, ſend greeting unto the Brethren which are of the Gentiles.</hi> But this is not our Caſe, who have neither head, nor heart, nor hand, nor finger, in impoſing thoſe burdens, which it ſeems good to my Lords the Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, to lay upon us: nor do we know what load we muſt bear, till we feel it, no more than the poor Pack-horſe knows before hand, what it ſhall pleaſe his good Lord and Maſter to lay upon him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That Decree was not to burden the Churches, but to eaſe them of thoſe burdens which they already groaned under. The Caſe was this, and it was ſad, and partly ours, <hi>Certain men came down from</hi> Judea, <hi>and taught the Brethren, that except they were circumciſed after the manner of</hi> Moſes, <hi>they could not be ſaved,</hi> ver. 1. Againſt this Tyranny <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> the great Aſſertors of Chriſtian liberty, made vigorous oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. but the Zealots having reinforced their Faction, from ſome of <hi>the Sect of the Phariſees, who believed,</hi> ver. 5. the Caſe comes before the Council, who determine againſt thoſe Bigots, that their blind zeal ſhould not be the meaſure <hi>of neceſſary, and unneceſſary,</hi> and yet not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate them too much, leſt perhaps they ſhould revolt from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and apoſtatize to <hi>Moſes,</hi> (which they were now in a fair way to do, and ſome of them afterwards did) they agree to lay upon the Gentile Converts <hi>no greater burthen than thoſe neceſſary things,</hi> in oppoſition to thoſe other unneceſſary things, which the Judaizing Chriſtians contended for as neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we conſider <hi>the things impoſed,</hi> we ſhall find them none of thoſe Trifles, which the more pragmatical After-Ages divided the Churches with: <hi>Abſtaining from meats offered to Idols, from blood, from things ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49933:27"/>
and from fornication,</hi> ver. 25. Of which, <hi>Fornication</hi> was in its ſelf unlawful; <hi>meats offered to Idols</hi> (under that notion) were then, and are ſtill unlawful to be eaten; <hi>things ſtrangled,</hi> had preſcription and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from moſt Reverend Antiquity, againſt their uſe; and by <hi>Blood,</hi> ſome underſtand <hi>Murther,</hi> in which ſenſe that alſo was ſimply unlawful; but if <hi>by Blood</hi> be underſtood, <hi>Fleſh with the life thereof which is the Blood,</hi> Gen. 9.4. that is, a limb taken from a living creature, and ſo eaten; to forbid that, was no more than to forbid them to be <hi>Canibals:</hi> and if thereby we will underſtand <hi>Blood</hi> in the moſt general acceptation, yet that alſo was ſo averſe to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that it's no wonder if the Church agreed to gratifie them in it. Nay, I have known (amongſt ſome others) a Reverend Dignitary of our Church, who from this Decree, and the Precepts given to the ſons of <hi>Noah,</hi> Religiouſly abſtained from all things ſtrangled, and from blood, to his dying day.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The end of that Decree, was to avoid <hi>Scandal;</hi> the morality of which, had it been well underſtood by theſe raw Gentile Converts, had taught them to deny themſelves in a greater matter than things ſtrangled, and blood, rather than give offence to their weak Brethren, without troubling the Church to make any Decree about them: And when this Canon was in its greateſt force and vigor, the Gentile Believers might have eaten the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>privately,</hi> yea, in <hi>company,</hi> where no offence would be given or taken; for what was the Jewiſh Convert concern'd what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſhould eat at home, either of the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or fragments of heatheniſh Sacrifices, preſented to him by his Relations, or of thoſe things killed by ſuffocation? But alas! the Caſe is otherwiſe with us; for ſuch is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Croſs, the white Garment, kneeling at the Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the omiſſion of them ſhall ſilence and ſuſpend a learned, faithful, labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>ab officio, &amp; beneficio,</hi> from his work and wages.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Apoſtles add no penalty, neither pecuniary, corporal, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, to afright men into compliance with it; but contented themſelves to have commanded in the Name of Chriſt, and of his true Church; they made not <hi>thoſe neceſſary things,</hi> the conditions of <hi>miniſterial, or lay-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; Significavits,</hi> Writs <hi>de Excommunicato Capiendo,</hi> were not then invented, nor till a long time after that the Lady Churches having loſt the true ſpiritual Sword, began to arm themſelves with ſecular power, to back and ſet an edge upon their Dictates.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This Decree was onely <hi>negative,</hi> not <hi>poſitive;</hi> a <hi>reſtraint from</hi> the uſe of ſome, but not an impoſition <hi>of any.</hi> It was onely, This you ſhall
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49933:28"/>
                  <hi>not Do;</hi> not, This you <hi>ſhall Do!</hi> which kind of Canons are much eaſier than the other: Conſcience may better be tyed up <hi>from acting in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> than forced to <hi>act in one particular.</hi> A negative precept reſtrains us from acting at any time, in any Caſe; an affirmative always obliges, but obliges not always to act in every Caſe: But things at home are much otherwiſe, where we are commanded both <hi>what to do,</hi> and <hi>what not to do;</hi> and are ſtill conſtrain'd to act, even in thoſe things we apprehend againſt the command of God either in general, or ſpecial.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Laſtly, It appears from the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s After-writings, that when this Decree had a little gratified the Jewiſh Converts, weaned them a little from their old cuſtoms and uſages, whereof they were ſo tenacious, molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their moroſe and rugged tempers, ſweeten'd and endear'd them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it expired of courſe, (as to what obligation it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from man) and lay among thoſe obſolete Canons, which were not regarded, becauſe antiquated; for when the reaſon of an humane Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Law ceaſes, the Law itſelf ceaſes, without any <hi>formal Repeal,</hi> which becauſe ſome expected ſhould have been more ſolemn, they will not be beaten out on't, but it's ſtill in force.</p>
               <p>Thus have we ſeen the Vanity of the Doctor's Suppoſition, which he would perſuade us is the Apoſtles, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>there was a neceſſity of one fixed and certain Rule, notwithſtanding the different attainments among Chriſtians:</hi> Which I am not afraid to call <hi>vain,</hi> being ſo dark, that we neither know whether the Rule muſt be of Divine, or Humane Inſtitution, what the matter of it muſt be; nor is it proved by Reaſon, or any Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture argument, but what is ultimately reſolved into that Decree made at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which I have now fully ſhewn will do him nor his Cauſe any ſervice.</p>

               <p>THe Reverend Dr. having toiled hard to prove the neceſſity of a fixed ſtanding Rule, notwithſtanding the different attainments of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians about unneceſſary matters, and caught nothing to reward his pains, bethinks himſelf of an objection, that Diſſenters might poſſibly make, which he thus words for them: <hi>Doth not the Apoſtle</hi> in the 14th. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Rom. lay down quite another Rule?</hi> viz. <hi>only of mutual forbearance in ſuch Caſes where men are unſatisfied in Conſcience?</hi> Yes, he doth ſo, and the ſame Rule he lays down in the verſe before the Drs. Text: <hi>That if any were otherwiſe minded,</hi> they ſhould wait, and not Act; the Church ſhould wait and not impoſe, but leave them to the inſtruction of God. To which the Dr. gives an intimation of a general anſwer: That there was a vaſt difference between the caſe as it ſtood then at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the caſe as it ſtood at <hi>Philippi:</hi> For, (ſayes he) <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>conſiſted moſt of Jews, where they did not impoſe the neceſſity of keeping the Law on the gentile Chriſtians. —And therefore in this caſe he perſwades both parties to forbearance and charity.</hi> But now, <hi>in thoſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> (ſuppoſe at <hi>Philippi</hi> for one) <hi>where the falſe Apoſtles made uſe of the pretence of the Levitical Law being ſtill in force to divide the Churches, there the Apoſtle bids them beware of them and their practices, as being of a dangerous and pernicious conſequence: So that the preſerving the peace of the Church, and preventing ſeparation was the great meaſure, according to which the Apoſtle gave his Directions, and that makes him inſiſt ſo much on this adviſe to the</hi> Philippians; <hi>that whatever their attainments were, they ſhould walk by the ſame Rule, and mind the ſame things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have often obſerved that when men are pinch't with plain Scripture, they uſe to twiſt and twine, and turn themſelves into all ſhapes, to get out of their ſtreights: and they have no more ordinary way of evaſion, than to fancy ſome imaginary various Caſes, upon which a various judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be made, and a various Rule laid down, to ſerve the preſent turn; which is moſt notorious in this anſwer. <hi>The Apoſtle acted like a prudent governour,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>and in ſuch a manner, as he</hi> thought <hi>did tend most to the propagation of the Goſpel, and good of particular Churches:</hi> To
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49933:29"/>
which ſome would reply; that then there are a great many in the world that have acted like fools: But my general anſwer is, that the Apoſtle acted upon higher Reaſons, than thoſe dictated to humane prudence, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the infallible guidance, and immediate direction of the Holy Ghoſt; Divine directions, and the ſupernatural counſels of the H. Spirit, are well conſiſtent; and had he only gone upon <hi>(thinking)</hi> as the Dr. fancies, I had rather have built my faith and practice, upon one of his <hi>thinkings,</hi> than upon one of the Drs. <hi>full perſwaſions,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.40. <hi>I think</hi> alſo that I have the Spirit of God. And he was not deceived in <hi>ſo thinking.</hi> But for a particular anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">§ 1. The Doctors Reaſon why <hi>the Jewiſh profeſſors at</hi> Rome <hi>did not impoſe on the gentile Chriſtians, the neceſſity of keeping the Law of</hi> Moſes, is this, Becauſe <hi>we do not find they did ſo!</hi> And is not this an ingenious courſe for a perſon of his learning to ſuppoſe the main foundation upon which he builds, the variety of the caſe, with no other proof, but that he does <hi>not find it ſo?</hi> I do not find a thouſand things that they did, and muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to have done, and may I thence conclude they never did 'em; and thence make what inferences, collections, and concluſions I think good?</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. He aſſerts, that becauſe the <hi>Apoſtle was willing to have the law buried with as little noiſe as might be, that therefore in this caſe, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades both parties to forbearance and charity.</hi> And what is that <hi>other caſe,</hi> or thoſe <hi>other caſes</hi> wherein the Apoſtle would diſpenſe with <hi>forbearance and charity?</hi> Are there any <hi>ſelect and reſerved caſes</hi> wherein he would have Chriſtians fall together by the ears? was it a duty at <hi>Rome</hi> not <hi>to judge, and deſpiſe</hi> one another? and will theſe be ſuch <hi>Cardinal Virtues</hi> at <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi?</hi> or were they at <hi>Rome</hi> only to <hi>ſtand or fall to their own Maſter</hi> and muſt the poor wretches at <hi>Philippi</hi> be ſold for Galley-ſlaves? was it good Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in one Church, that every man ſhould be <hi>fully perſwaded in his own mind,</hi> before he adventured upon acting? and was it Heterodox in the other, that they might debauch and proſtitute conſcience to all pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſet their ſouls for every dog to piſs on? If the Doctor preſumed upon his Auditors, had he the ſame confidence to impoſe upon his Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. The Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Canons of 1640. tells us ſhe <hi>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Rule preſcribed by the Apoſtle</hi> in this chapter to the <hi>Romans:</hi> and has 40. years more ſo altered the caſe? If the <hi>Rule of Charity, preſcribed by the Apoſtle</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> does reach us here in <hi>England,</hi> it's leſs matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it obliged them at <hi>Philippi</hi> or no; and yet that it obliged them alſo has been made clear from the Text.</p>

                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49933:29"/>§ 4. The Dr. manifeſtly prevaricates when he tells us, <hi>The Apoſtle does ſo much inſiſt upon this advice to the</hi> Phillippians, <hi>that whatever their attainments were, they ſhould walk by the ſame Rule,</hi> when the innocent Apoſtle inſiſts upon no ſuch thing! He commands (as I have oft obſerved) the clear contrary, that <hi>different attainments</hi> ſhould have different walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and practices, that they are to walk as they <hi>have attained,</hi> and not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> they <hi>have not attained:</hi> And that Rule to which the Apoſtle refers, that which he injoyns is a Rule that may be equally obſerved under different attainments as under the ſame: namely, that evangelical Rule of charity, which neither infringes chriſtian liberty, nor violates conſcience, but teaches us to exerciſe forbearance of one another, notwithſtanding our different attaintments, which is that <hi>Royal Law,</hi> commanded by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 2.8. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Not to be repealed by all the authority on earth, nor ever will, by that of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. If the Apoſtle <hi>bids the Churches beware of thoſe who make uſe of the pretence of the Levitical Law being ſtill in force to divide the Churches;</hi> He does alſo by parity of Reaſon bid us beware too of thoſe who upon pretence of any other Ceremonies, old Cuſtoms, and apocryphal uſages divide the Church, and render Communion with it grievous and burdenſom; and I hope we ſhall hearken to his advice, <hi>to beware of them,</hi> and truſt them no further than needs muſt; eſpecially when thoſe old cuſtoms have been found of ſuch <hi>dangerous and pernicious conſequences,</hi> that they have divided and almoſt ruined a moſt flouriſhing Church, and madeway for a common Enemy to break in with utmoſt fury upon us.</p>

               <p>THe Reverend Doctor having at length got over the flats, and bars, that lay at the mouth of the channel, is now hoiſing up his main Sail to the wind: And can we expect his diſcourſe ſhould run more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and ſmoothly? for having begg'd one half of the controverſie, he may more eaſily borrow the reſt of it. And therefore from <hi>the obligation that lies upon Chriſtians, to walk by the ſame Rule</hi> (that is, <hi>ſuch a Rule as</hi> he has made for the Apoſtle, and us) <hi>There will ariſe</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>two very conſiderable Queſtions:</hi> that is to ſay, where one abſurditie is granted, <hi>two more</hi> (nay twenty) <hi>will follow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Queſtion. <hi>How far the obligation doth extend to comply with an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht Rule, and to preſerve the Peace of the Church we live in?</hi> This Queſtion I confeſs is conſiderable, very conſiderable, had he told us <hi>what the Rule eſtabliſht is:</hi> for there are very crooked ones in the World; and who muſt be the <hi>Rule maker?</hi> for there are many pretenders; and then proved that we are to comply with it; but to enquire how far we are to comply, and not make it out, <hi>that we are to comply at all,</hi> to ſuch Rules as he has contrived, is not ſo <hi>conſiderable</hi> as he would perſwade us. And yet ſeeing the hare is ſtarted, I wiſh it were caught, and ſince he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the queſtion, it had been well if he had anſwered it, which we might demand in Juſtice, but ſhall take it for a ſpecial favour, if he will at any time hereafter, <hi>tell us how far we are to comply with an eſtabliſht Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At preſent he cannot be at leiſure; in the mean time, <hi>for the preventing all miſunderſtanding the deſign of his Diſcourſe, he deſires us to conſider;</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) That he <hi>ſpeaks not of the ſeparation, or diſtinct communion</hi> of whole Churches <hi>from each other:</hi> we are glad of that: Firſt, becauſe if he allow ſeparation by <hi>whole ſale,</hi> we ſhall do the better, if the <hi>retail</hi> trade be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed: And ſecondly, becauſe hereby the Churches of the diſſenters will
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49933:30"/>
be out of the way his anger: for (as he adds) Theſe whole Churches, <hi>according to Scripture, Antiquity and Reaſon, have a juſt right and power to reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> If then the Churches of the diſſenters be but true Churches, and whole Churches; If they have in them all the eſſentials of Churches; If they have paſtors rightly qualified, duly choſen, the word of God purely preached, the Sacraments duly adminiſtred, and all other ordinances of Chriſt regularly uſed, they have then power to govern and reform themſelves.</p>
               <p>But <hi>by whole Churches, he means the Churches of ſuch nations which upon the decay of the Roman Empire reſumed their juſt right of government to themſelves, and upon their owning Chriſtianity incorporated into one Chriſtian ſociety under the ſame common Ties, and Rules of Government.</hi> To which I anſwer;</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's not material in this Caſe what Churches <hi>he means;</hi> for if they be true Churches of Chriſt, his <hi>ill meaning</hi> will not deprive them; if they be <hi>not ſo,</hi> his <hi>good meaning will not give them a power to reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be quaeried how thoſe <hi>Churches of the nations which ſeparated from the Roman Empire,</hi> came by this great priviledge <hi>to reform and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themſelves,</hi> more than others? for if it be an inherent power, and right, all Churches have it; <hi>if not,</hi> who could give it to ſome more than others?</p>
               <p n="3">3. We ſhould be glad to ſee what right to <hi>govern and reform themſelves</hi> was given by the <hi>Scripture to national Churches;</hi> (which yet the Doctor affirms) It had been very convenient to have proved their <hi>Being</hi> from Scripture, before he aſſerted their <hi>right and power:</hi> And it will make men admire, that the Scripture ſhould give a right to ſuch Churches as it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And if the Churches of thoſe nations, that were incorporated into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches upon the decay of the Roman Empire, did by conſent embody for their own preſervation, it can hardly be believed, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd their own deſtruction; that is, that thoſe particular Churches ſhould grant a power to National Eccleſiaſtical Governours that would deprive them of that power that they had within themſelves: For as it cannot be imagined that ever any number of families would embody to ſet a civil Governour over them, and entruſt him with a power that would deſtroy propriety, or take away paternal authority, or the juſt power of Maſters over Servants; ſo neither can we ſuppoſe in a dream, that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches ſhould agree to unite in ſuch a national frame, as ſhould deſtroy the power of the Paſtors and Elders of the particular aſſemblies, ſo as they ſhould be but the Curates, and their Churches but Chappels of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49933:31"/>
to the Cathedrals, and Biſhops, which were prudential Creatures, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected meerly by their own conſent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To ſay <hi>that the Church of</hi> Macedonia <hi>would have been</hi> National, <hi>if from being a Roman province, it had become a Chriſtian Kingdom,</hi> is to ſay thus much and no more: That there would have been a national Church in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> but for a ſmall inconvenience, that there was none.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And to ſay, <hi>that the ſeveral Churches of the</hi> Lydian, or proconſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Aſia <hi>would have been a</hi> National Church, <hi>if they had been united in one Kingdom, and governed by the ſame authority under the ſame Rules:</hi> is to ſay, juſt <hi>as much,</hi> that is, <hi>nothing</hi> or nothing to the purpoſe: for the unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſeveral Churches under one Prince, who governs them by the ſame Authority and Rules, will not make one Church.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And what ſtrange kind of Churches were they, <hi>who having aſſumed their juſt right of Government, did then own Chriſtianity,</hi> and then incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate into one Church? where had they their juſt right of Government, before their owning of Chriſtianity?</p>
               <p n="8">8. And if theſe particular Churches of Nations, had power to incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into one National Church; then the <hi>particular Churches</hi> are of Chriſts inſtitution, and theſe <hi>National Churches</hi> only prudential contrivances for common ſecurity: and then it will follow that the National could have no power but what was freely given them by the particular Churches, which cannot be imagined was ever given to their own Annihilation, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them meerly titular; and perhaps they may reſume their right, when as weighty reaſons do appear for the reſumption, as ever there were for their reſignation.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And if theſe particular Churches have ſo far devolved all the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick power which Chriſt veſted them with, upon the National frame, and conſtitution, that they cannot now govern themſelves, reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or exert the power which they ſometimes had and enjoyed; then have they unchurched themſelves, and remain only ſo much matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form; and then it can be no ſchiſm to ſeparate from them, ſince all corruptions among them muſt be immortal when they have fooliſhly quitted the power of reforming themſelves, except the National Church pleaſes.</p>
               <p>This word Church, has made a great noiſe in the world, and we hear every moment, what wonders, what miracles the Church can do: Now there's a natural curioſity in all men to ſee that perſon or thing that boaſts of this wonder-working power, and accordingly, we would gladly be acquainted with this body called Church: To ſatisfie our Humour, the Doctor tells us, <hi>That the true Notion of a Church, is no more than a ſociety
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49933:31"/>
of men united together for their order, and government, according to the Rules of the Chriſtian Religion:</hi> which deſcription I perceive marvelouſly edifies all that hear it: For a Parliament is a ſociety of men, and of men united, and united for their order and government, and truly I believe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of the Chriſtian Religion. <hi>Quare</hi> now, <hi>whether the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>be not the Church of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>I humbly conceive the Doctor fell aſleep in the next words; <hi>It's a great miſtake</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to make a Church barely to relate to Acts of Worſhip; and conſequently that the true Notion of a Church, is an Aſſembly for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip:</hi> For never certainly was any ſo bereaved of common ſenſe, as to aſſert that this is the adaequate Notion of a Church. It had been civil to have quoted ſome one obſcure Nonconformiſt, that in ſome Book which none ever read but the Doctor, has aſſerted ſuch an Abſurdity. We ſay that the Publick Worſhip of God is one of the Ends of uniting into a Church Society, but not the onely End; and to exclude <hi>Worſhip,</hi> (as the Doctor ſeems to do in his deſcription) is as bad, if not worſe, than to exclude Diſcipline and Government: But we agree that Worſhip is not the onely End, there muſt be Government, Diſcipline exerciſed in every Church; what will the Doctor gain by all this, but that our Parochial Churches are not true Churches? And when the Doctor ſays further, <hi>There must be ſome other Bond to unite Churches,</hi> (ſome other beſides Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) I cannot enough admire at the abſurdity of the expreſſion, ſeeing Worſhip is not the Bond, but the End of Union.</p>
               <p>It has been familiar with this Reverend and Learned Perſon, having been employ'd in more important Controverſies, either to miſtake, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent the Notions and Principles of the Diſſenters: for ſo I find him, <hi>Anſw. to ſeveral Treatiſes,</hi> p. 180, 181. laying this down <hi>as a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Principle (of thoſe who ſeparate from the Church of</hi> England) <hi>as to Worſhip, (wherein the difference lies) that nothing is lawful in the Worſhip of God, but what he has expreſly commanded:</hi> And at the bottom of the ſame Page, he repeats the ſame thing, with the ſame confidence; wherein the Doctor treads in the ſteps of <hi>Archbiſhop Whitgift,</hi> (and he muſt tread in his ſteps if ever he reach <hi>Lambeth</hi>) who in his anſwer to the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, does charge the Puritans to hold, That nothing was lawful in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but what was expreſly commanded in the Word of God; upon no better ground, than that the Admonition had ſaid, nothing is lawful in Worſhip, but what God has commanded. To this Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>Is this to interpret mens words? Are theſe Phraſes equipollent, [Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and expreſly commanded?] Many things are forbidden, many things commanded, which are neither</hi> expreſly <hi>commanded, or forbidden. We ſay
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49933:32"/>
not, no Ceremony, no Order, no Diſcipline is lawful</hi> in the Church, but <hi>what is expreſly found in the Word of God; but that men may</hi> not act arbitrariouſly, <hi>that they are bound to conform themſelves to the general Rules of the Scripture, which are given forth as a Rule by which to ſquare all Religious matters.</hi> Thus far Mr. <hi>Cartwright.</hi> And ſo do we openly and freely own that direct, immediate conſequence from Scripture, or whatever is included in the general Rules of Scripture ſhall conclude and determine us in theſe diſputes.</p>
               <p>Here again the Doctor thinks he has gravelled us with an unanſwerable queſtion.</p>
               <p>If (ſaies he) <hi>it be mutual conſent, and agreement which makes a Church, why then may not national Societies agreeing together in the ſame faith, and under the ſame government, and diſcipline be as truly, and properly a Church, as any particular Congregation?</hi> I will tell him why, if he pleaſe to hear me out with patience. 1. Becauſe it is not mutual conſent and agreement and alone in the general, but ſuch agreement, and conſent as the Goſpel warrants, which we have for particular Churches, which were well known to the Scriptures, but not for National, to which conſtitution, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are perfect ſtrangers. 2. Becauſe the end of that conſent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be conſidered, and looked at; which is union for worſhip, though not for worſhip alone, to which end national union ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſeeing that a National Church (unleſs it be a Church no larger than the Kingdom of <hi>Ivetot</hi>) can never meet together for that end. 3. Becauſe the particular Churches muſt conſent to nothing that may deſtroy their own government, and power of reforming whatever corruptions by length of time ſteal and creep in among them: But if his meaning be, that they may be <hi>called a Church,</hi> it's little to us, what he ſhall pleaſe to call them, ſeeing we do not intend to draw the Saw of contention about the Nomenclature of that or any other Body.</p>
               <p>From reaſoning, the Doctor proceeds to <hi>wondring at thoſe who cannot tell what is meant by the Church of</hi> England; and he will inform their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance concerning it: <hi>We mean</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>That ſociety of Chriſtian people which in this Nation are united under the ſame profeſſion of faith, the ſame laws of government, and Rules of divine worſhip.</hi> Whence it will follow that the Churches of diſſenters are each of them the <hi>Church of England:</hi> For every one of them is, 1. <hi>A ſociety of Chriſtian people;</hi> though perhaps in his judgment but bad ones, yet as good as their Neighbours. 2. <hi>They are in this Nation;</hi> though full ſore againſt ſome mens wills; who would
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49933:32"/>
have them removed by <hi>Capital puniſhments or baniſhment.</hi> 3. They are united under the ſame profeſſion of faith: that is, one half of them are not <hi>Socinians or Arminians</hi> and the other half <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> 4. <hi>They are united under the ſame laws of Government.</hi> 5. And they have <hi>the ſame Rules of divine worſhip:</hi> And then it follows too by the Doctor's conceſſion, they have a right of governing each Church its own ſelf, and of reforming er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in Doctrine, and corruptions in worſhip.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this famous definition, what man is the wiſer, or knows more than he did before <hi>what the Church of</hi> England <hi>is?</hi> For, 1. We underſtand not by this Deſcription, who is the viſible head of this Church; whether a <hi>civil or eccleſiaſtical perſon,</hi> and by conſequence are at a loſs whether the Church may be called <hi>a civil or eccleſiaſtical conſtitution.</hi> 2. We are not informed how this National Church became ſo united; whether they were driven together by violence, or drew together by their conſent; whether it was not ſome ſtorm or tempeſt that might joſtle them all on a heap, or whether the conſent of the particular Congregations was asked, and obtained in order to this coalition: We have ſeen ſome Churches in this nation, that have had their Paſtors torn from them, and the Sheep ſcattered; ſtrangers obtruded upon others, whoſe perſons they knew not, whoſe miniſterial gifts they had no trial of, and all his right to them was, that he was nominated by a certain Gentleman called the Patron, and the inſtitution of the Dioceſan, and if with their conſent it was ſuch a one as was obtained by dureſs; and do well call this uniting; what was it then which united them? why ſome of the Miniſters of the Parochial Churches met together, and choſe one or two out of their number, and ſent them up to a convocation, and theſe meeting with ſome others, they call Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, Deans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> agreed upon a national Church-frame, without the leaſt conſent of many of the particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. And this is the too much boaſted Union.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Another thing he would have us conſider, is, He does <hi>not intend to ſpeak of the Terms upon which perſons are to be admitted to the exerciſe of the function of the Miniſtry, but of the Terms of Lay-communion.</hi> And it was adviſedly done; for if it be ſo difficult to render Lay-communion practicable, what will it be to juſtifie all thoſe terms upon which Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are admitted to the function of the Miniſtry, or the exerciſe of it? But why does he mention <hi>the exerciſe of the function,</hi> and <hi>not the function</hi> it ſelf? Do they uſe to ordain Miniſters to a Miniſterial work, and then prohibit them to exerciſe the work of their miniſtry till further order? Muſt men pay for an <hi>Order to Act,</hi> and then be put to purchaſe another
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49933:33"/>
order that they may act according to their order? ſurely one of theſe fees might have been ſaved, and it might have been ſufficient either to buy a Licenſe to preach without ordination, or an ordination to preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Licenſe: The Country Chancellors are more merciful, who do not uſually, that I hear of, ſell a man a Licenſe to marry, and then Compel him to take another Licenſe to lie with his Bride,</p>
               <p>It is confeſſed that the Terms upon which Miniſters are admitted to their function, and the exerciſe of it, are more ſevere than thoſe upon which the Laity (as they love to call them) are admitted to communion in the word and Sacraments; and there might be reaſon for it, ſeeing the Laity held no good fat Parſonages, that might tempt any to eject them: But yet the Terms are not ſuch eaſie things of digeſtion, but they lie upon the ſtomachs of thouſands to this day, and ſome of them are as hard to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as the biggeſt gobblets that are impoſed upon the Clergy; and they are apt to think that the ſame terms that are impoſed upon their Paſtors, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon themſelves by conſequence, ſeeing they approve interpretatively their Miniſters ſubſcriptions, their declarations, their oaths, by owning them for their Paſtors, whom they know upon ſuch terms to have been aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them; nor do they love to have him for their Paſtor whom they know to be of a different Religion from theirs: But here are ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, wherein the Reader will deſire the Doctor's ingenuity, and that plainneſs which became a ſermon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He aſſerts <hi>that there has been a great deal of art uſed to confound theſe two;</hi> this I ſay is not honeſt dealing; for they that Judge parochial Lay-communion lawful, and have the greateſt latitude that way, have from Preſs and Pulpit ſufficiently proclaimed their minds; and they that judge otherwiſe have by their own practice and example ſufficiently declared their judgment, unleſs the Doctor be angry that they do not fill up their publick worſhip with declamations againſt Ceremonies; and they that have made the neareſt approaches to Parochial Communion, have found ſuch bad treatment, that they are tempted to judge, the Clergy are more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of their coming wholly in, than keeping out of the Church, and they are to be allowed the fitteſt judges in this caſe, becauſe they know beſt what ſtock the Church-commons will bear: In the mean time they may take warning how they approach too near that flame which has already ſinged ſome or their wings, and may poſſibly conſume their whole bodies, but conſciencious men are above thoſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Doctor tells us, <hi>that in the Judgment of the moſt impartial a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the diſſenters, little is to be ſaid on the behalf of the people from whom none of thoſe things are required.</hi> None of theſe things? what, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49933:33"/>
their Children to God by the ſign of the croſs? not to kneel at the Sacrament? I am ſure the Canons of 1603. have declared (<hi>Can.</hi> 30.) <hi>that in memory of the Croſs, and other Reaſons, the Church of</hi> England <hi>hath thought meet to retain the ſign of the Croſs in baptiſm, taking it for a ſymbol,</hi> whereby the Infant <hi>is devoted or dedicated to the ſervice of him who dyed the death of the Croſs:</hi> This is the true import of that Canon, which I cannot now give the Reader the Engliſh of <hi>Verbatim,</hi> having only by me a Latine Copy of thoſe Canons. And thoſe of the moſt impartial among the diſſenters, and ſuch as have come neareſt to conformity in their Lay-Capacity, will tell you that there are ſome things which even they in their private ſtation cannot comply withall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Doctor <hi>does not underſtand, how they can preach lawfully to a people who commit a ſin in hearing them.</hi> Either then the things are unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, or the Dr. is not that man of underſtanding we have always taken him for: what the <hi>Diviſions of Reuben</hi> were, he does not well underſtand, p. 2. <hi>Why many Cities united under one civil government, and the ſame Rules of Religion, ſhould not be called one national Church, he cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,</hi> p. 19. <hi>And if occaſional Communion be lawful, that conſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſhould not be a duty, is hard to underſtand,</hi> p. 56. And now here <hi>how they can preach lawfully to a people, who commit a fault in hearing them, he does not underſtand.</hi> But what great difficulty lies in this? Some do ſin though they hear, and yet not ſin becauſe they hear; or there may be a ſin in the hearer, and yet no ſin in hearing; but whatever the tempers or diſtempers, the ends and deſigns of the hearers are, that which juſtifies the Miniſters preaching is his own call to the Miniſtry, not the qualification of the hearers: A man may come from the next pariſh to hear the Doctor, when by the Rules of the Church he ſhould have been in his own pariſh Church, and yet the Doctor will not think that this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedes the exerciſe of his Miniſtry. Some may come out of cuſtom becauſe they have uſed to trundle thither down the hill; others out of curioſity to hear a perſon of whom fame has ſpoken ſo much; others out of a carping humour to pick quarrels, as no doubt Prieſts, and Jeſuites have done, and yet the Doctor ſatisfies himſelf, that it is his duty to do his Maſters work, and however they hear ſinfully, ſchiſmatically, captiouſly, yet he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted in his miniſterial ſervice.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) The Doctor tells us, he does <hi>not confound bare ſuſpending Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in ſome particular Rites, with either total, or at leaſt ordinary forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Communion in what they judge lawful, and proceeding to the forming of ſeparate Congregations.</hi> What great matter is it to us, or to the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49933:34"/>
what the Doctor ſhall pleaſe to confound, or to diſtinguiſh? The law of the nation, which is the aſſigned Rule and Reaſon of Conformity, requires total Conformity to all Rites. The Law conſiders not whether mens <hi>ſcruples be modeſt, or immodeſt,</hi> nor what they judge lawful or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; Conformity is exacted to the whole Liturgy, Ceremonies, and the Laity muſt not pick and chuſe what they can uſe, and refuſe the reſt; they muſt like Travellours on the King's high way, keep to the road, and not break out here and there to eſcape the foul way: If the Doctor were the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or the Parliament, it were conſiderable, but as the caſe ſtands, we are under a peremptory law: Now then, if there be ſome things which we do ſcruple, and not only ſcruple, but upon the moſt impartial ſcrutiny we can make, do judge ſinful, and theſe be made the condition of enjoying one Sacrament, or other Ordinance of Chriſt, and that by a law of his as peremptory as any of theſe of men, and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a far more ſevere penalty than man can inflict, we are bound to live in the conſtant uſe of all his inſtitutions; we muſt unite our ſelves to thoſe churches where we may enjoy them upon better terms.</p>
               <p>Thus much in conſideration of his conſiderations: But yet we are to ſeek for the anſwer to the Queſtion: <hi>How far we are obliged to comply with an eſtabliſht Rule?</hi> Separation of whole Churches is ſhut out of the Queſtion; Miniſterial Conformity is ſhut out of the Queſtion; Suſpending Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſome particular Rites is ſhut out of the Queſtion; But where is the anſwer to the Queſtion? That is adjourned or prorogued, or utterly loſt, and therefore <hi>if any honeſt Gentleman or Citizen has taken up the anſwer to this queſtion, loſt between St.</hi> Pauls <hi>and the</hi> Guild-Hall Chappel, <hi>let him reſtore it to the owner, and he will be well rewarded for his pains.</hi> And now let the Reader judge, whether the diſſenters are not likely to be well inſtructed by a Catechiſm, made up of Queſtions without Anſwers?</p>

               <p>THE former Queſtion being laid by at preſent, he comes to <hi>conſider the preſent Caſe of Separation, and to make the ſinfulneſs and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49933:34"/>
of it appear:</hi> And this is it, which denominates the Diſcourſe, <hi>The Miſchief of Separation:</hi> Though to an impartial Conſiderer, how loth they are to ſtep over a ſtraw, or to forgo the leaſt of their Impoſitions, which have made the Separation, it might better have been ſtiled, <hi>The Miſchief of Union.</hi> Now to do this, (as he thinks more convincingly) he will firſt lay down ſome <hi>Conceſſions.</hi> It had been a more convincing method in the judgment of moſt Men, if he had proved Separation ſinful from Scripture grounds, rather than from ſome Mens Conceſſions, ſeeing I do not underſtand either that we are bound to ſtand to their Conceſſions, or that the Conceſſions themſelves will do his Cauſe the leaſt ſervice: And they themſelves have been ſo bang'd by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> by this <hi>Argumentum ad hominem,</hi> that one would think they ſhould have little comfort to uſe it. We cannot forget how in the Relation of the Conference between the A. B. <hi>Laud,</hi> and the Jeſuite, the <hi>Lady</hi> who gave occaſion to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, asked this Queſtion, <hi>Whether a Perſon living and dying in Communion with the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>might be ſaved?</hi> His <hi>Grace</hi> anſwered affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. Now what Triumphs before the Victory the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have made upon this Conceſſion, the Doctor has ſufficient cauſe to underſtand: <hi>You</hi> (ſay they) <hi>confeſs that Salvation is attainable in Communion with us:</hi> we peremptorily deny it, <hi>That Salvation may be had in your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;</hi> And therefore the ſafeſt way is, to hold Communion there where both ſides agree Salvation may be attained. This Argument from that Conceſſion is much ſtronger, than one drawn from the Conceſſion of any one or many amongſt us; becauſe we own no learned Men to be our Eccleſiaſtical Head, as that Archbiſhop was ſuppoſed to have been theirs. But thus fared it with them for their Charity to <hi>Rome,</hi> and thus fares it with us for our Charity to them; they cannot own <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church, and that perſons in that Communion may be ſaved, but they muſt hear on't on both ſides of their ears; why then did you ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from a true Church, wherein you might have been ſaved? Nor muſt we grant the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be a true Church, but preſently we are pelted with the ſame Reply that was thrown at their heads, why then did you ſeparate? But we had rather ſuffer by our Charitableneſs, and their Uncharitableneſs, than admit any the leaſt Temptation to deny the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be a true Church, and to hold all the eſſential Points of Faith, ſeeing the Doctor himſelf has granted as much as this comes to, where he allows of Separation; yet let us hear what theſe Conceſſions are.</p>
               <p n="1">§ 1. <hi>They unanimouſly confeſs they find no fault with the Doctrinal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our Church.</hi> Doctrinal Articles? Are there then any <hi>Articles</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:49933:35"/>
that are not <hi>Doctrinal?</hi> Every Article contains, as I always thought, ſome Doctrine or other; and which then are the Non-doctrinal Articles? more particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not true, that the Diſſenters unanimouſly confeſs they find no fault with the Doctrine of the Church; for I am confident none of them but do find fault with that Doctrine, <hi>That Children baptized, and dying before the commiſſion of actual ſin, are undoubtedly ſaved.</hi> And that other, <hi>That whoſoever believeth not ſtedfaſtly all that is contained in the Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Creed, cannot be ſaved, but ſhall periſh everlaſtingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They do not believe all the Articles of the Thirty nine, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly not the 20th, of the Churches power to impoſe <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;</hi> and that alſo is a Doctrinal Article.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But if by <hi>Doctrinal Articles</hi> be intended no more, than thoſe that relate to the <hi>eſſential Points of ſaving Faith,</hi> it's true they find no fault with them, but then it's as true, that the Doctor has confeſt alſo, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintains all ſuch Articles, and yet he juſtifies the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from their Communion; whence it will unavoidably follow, that it is lawful to ſeparate from a Church which holds all the eſſential Points of Faith abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And what is it to the Laity, what Doctrinal Articles are contained in the Book compiled 1562. if the contrary Doctrines be now openly preached in thoſe Parochial Churches to which their adherence is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? For if their Communion with the Pariſh Churches be the thing which he mainly inſiſts on, it's of more concern to them what is there preach'd, than what Faith they were of an hundred years ago.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. <hi>They generally yield, that our Parochial Churches are true Churches, and it is with theſe their Communion is required.</hi> And are not then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Churches more beholden to the Diſſenters, than to the Doctor, whoſe Principles do deny them to be true Churches? For ſo he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 27. That although when the Churches encreaſed, the occaſional meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were frequent in ſeveral places, yet ſtill there was but one Church, and one Altar, and one Baptiſtry, and one Biſhop: So that the Parochial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations are but occaſional meetings, members and appurtenances of the Cathedral, Chappels of Eaſe under the Mother Church, but no true Churches, becauſe each has not its proper Biſhop: And ſo they make the Dioceſan Biſhop the onely Paſtor, and the Parochial Teachers to be onely his Curates, to eaſe them of the trouble and cumber of Preaching. And ſome have obſerved a ſtrange Innovation in the very office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of late years; for whereas in the old Ordination of Prieſts, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated them in their whole office, by reading that Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49933:35"/>
                  <hi>Feed the Flock, whereof the Holy Ghost hath made you Overſeers,</hi> or Biſhops. This Text is now omitted, and Miniſters are ordain'd to preach when and where the Biſhops ſhall give them a Licence. And thus the Parochial Teachers are no Officers of Chriſt, but creatures of the Biſhops making; nor have they any Juriſdiction, any power of Government or Diſcipline in their hands, (which all thoſe Paſtors whom Chriſt appointed are veſted with) but ſerve to execute the Decrees, Sentences, and Awards of the Chancellors, Officials, and Commiſſaries, without liberty to interpoſe ſo much as a judgment of diſcretion: And though they retain the name of <hi>Rectors,</hi> yet 'tis rather a footſtep of what once originally they were, but not any term that carries or imports in it any real Authority. And what if the Diſſenters do not deny that you have all the Eſſentials of true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, true Doctrine, true Sacraments, and an implicit Covenant between Paſtors and People? Do not alſo our great Clergymen own and allow, that <hi>Rome</hi> hath all theſe? The Doctor, I am certain, allows them to be true Churches, to have all the Eſſentials of true Churches, and that they have true Sacraments too; elſe why are not they re-baptized which from <hi>Rome</hi> are converted, and brought over to the Church of <hi>England?</hi> And true Miniſters, elſe why are they not re-ordained, who, after reconciliation, are allowed to exerciſe their Miniſterial Function? when yet a Miniſter or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Reformed Churches, ſhall not enjoy that priviledge, meerly for want of Epiſcopal Ordination. And will the Doctor deny that they have the Euchariſt in all its eſſential parts, though they have ſuperadded many groſs Corruptions? as they have many Errors in the Doctrine of Faith, which yet does not in his judgment, deſtroy the eſſential points of the Chriſtian Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>Many of them declare that they hold Communion with our Churches to be lawful.</hi> And then 1. Who is the true Catholick Chriſtian, and who is the real Schiſmatick? He that holds Communion with all Proteſtant Churches occaſionally lawful, and accordingly holds Communion with them actually as Providence gives him opportunity; or he that denying all Churches to be truly ſuch, except his own, refuſes Communion with them, for want of a Ceremony or two, and the neceſſary conſequence of a Ceremony, A Biſhop? 2. That they hold Communion with this Church to be lawful, is one of thoſe dubious Propoſitions which will do the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Party no harm, nor them that make uſe of it any ſervice. <hi>First,</hi> many of them declare ſo, and many declare otherwiſe; but they do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them prejudge the other, nor intend to bind them to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſentiments: and it's as good an argument to prove Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, becauſe many declare againſt it, as 'tis to prove it lawful, becauſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49933:36"/>
many declare for it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they declare Communion lawful, but do they declare total Communion lawful? The ſame perſons will tell us, that both theſe Propoſitions are true, Communion is lawful, and Communion is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; Communion in ſome parts of worſhip is ſo, in others not: And <hi>thirdly,</hi> they will further tell us, that Communion with ſome Pariſh-Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is lawful, with others unlawful; that there are not the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines preached, the ſame Ceremonies urged, the ſame rigid terms of Communion in all Churches exacted. And laſtly, that occaſional Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is or may be lawful, where a ſtated and fixed Communion is not ſo; and they give this reaſon for their judgment and practice, becauſe to hold Communion with one Church, or ſort of Chriſtians, excluſively to all others, is contrary to their true Catholick principles, which teach them to hold Communion, though not equally, with all tolerable Churches; and that there are ſome things tolerable which are not eligible, wherein they can bear with much for peace-ſake, but chuſe rather to ſit down ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with purer adminiſtrations.</p>
               <p>It is a dangerous thing to give us uncertain ambulatory Notions of Schiſm, other than what the Scripture has given us, both becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures alone can inform us what is the Notion of a true Church, and by conſequence what muſt be the true Notion of ſinful Separation from it; and becauſe theſe unſtable mutable Notions of Schiſm, will make that to be Schiſm in one Countrey, which is an innocent thing in another; and that to be Schiſm one year, which perhaps the next may prove a good and Catholick practice. That was Schiſm in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th's days, which was not ſo in Queen <hi>Maries;</hi> and that was Schiſm in Her Reign, which became none in the days of Her Succeſſor. And we may be Schiſmaticks here in <hi>England,</hi> when if we croſs the water we ſhall be none, though we practiſe the ſame Worſhip, and retain all that which at home would have faſtened that brand upon us. And if we travel through <hi>Germany,</hi> though perhaps we cannot be Schiſmaticks and Catholicks twice a day, becauſe the miles are very long, yet may we be both backwards and forwards forty times in a Twelvemonth, and continue the ſame men both in principle and practice that we were when we went our pilgrimage.</p>
               <p>It is little to our purpoſe, what the Doctor is pleaſed to tell us, what one told him, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1663. <hi>Divers Preachers met at</hi> London, <hi>to conſider how</hi> far it was lawful, or their duty <hi>to communicate with the Pariſh-Churches, where they lived, in the Liturgy and Sacraments:</hi> or that 20 <hi>Reaſons were brought in to prove, that it is a duty in ſome perſons, to join with ſome Pariſh-Churches three times a year in the Lord's Supper:</hi> For, 1. If they conſider'd <hi>how far it was lawful:</hi> I hope they ſpoke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49933:36"/>
at leaſt to the Queſtion, and left it not as they found it, a Queſtion forſaken of its Anſwer, which ought to be individual Companions. 2. They met to conſider what was lawful for, or a duty to <hi>themſelves,</hi> not for or to others in whoſe names they had no commiſſion to hear and determine the Queſtion. 3. If they inquired <hi>how far it was lawful, or a duty;</hi> they ſuppoſed that it was not unlimitedly ſo, for to what end ſhould they inquire how far they might go, if they had once thought they could go through? 4. And the deſign of the twenty reaſons abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proves it; for it was but <hi>ſome perſons,</hi> whoſe duty it was adjudged to be to receive the Sacrament thrice a year, and it was but in ſome pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es neither, where thoſe <hi>ſome perſons</hi> might communicate, ſo that there might be ſome others, many others, poſſibly the greateſt number, whoſe duty it was not ſo to joyn; and other ſome pariſhes, many others, and and poſſibly the greateſt number with whom it was not lawful or not a duty to hold Communion. The Caſe then is this, a Chriſtian may be placed in ſuch circumſtances, that he may receive the Sacrament from ſome perſons who will indulge him in the queſtionable Terms, in ſuch places where he cannot enjoy that ordinance at all if he do not receive it there; and thus with many reſtrictions, limitations, diſtinctions and clauſes a Caſe may be put, wherein the twenty reaſons may conclude ſome thing, but yet nothing to the Doctors advantage: But what effect, what operation had theſe twenty reaſons upon the Company? Why! <hi>none of them ſeemed to diſſent,</hi> that is, they did not enter their ſeveral proteſtations, nor formally declare againſt the Reaſons of their Brother; like wiſe and wary perſons, they would adviſe upon them: They came to conſider of the lawfulneſs of Communion, and they would go away and conſider of the ſtrength of the Reaſons propounded to convince them. I ſee it's more dangerous than I had thought it to have been, to come into the pariſh Churches, leſt naked preſence, and ſilent appearing in thoſe aſſemblies, ſhould be brought againſt us, as an interpretative approbation of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is there done or ſpoken.</p>
               <p>The Doctor adds, that they had <hi>ſuch another meeting after the plague and fire,</hi> (and if it were but <hi>ſuch another,</hi> there was no great harm in't) <hi>at which they agreed that communion with our Church was in it ſelf law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and good;</hi> for which he quotes <hi>Plea for Peace.</hi> p. 240. But here the Doctor is tardy by his favour, and wrongs his Relator manifeſtly, by nibbling off the laſt and moſt conſiderable words of the ſentence—<hi>viz. when it would do no more harm than good:</hi> And we believe it lawful in that Caſe to hold Communion with any Church in the world, ſo that now we muſt come to another enquiry, and ſtart a new queſtion, when there are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49933:37"/>
one or two already up before the Dogs, viz. <hi>whether Communion with the Pariſh-Churches will do more harm than good?</hi> which it will certainly do, 1. When ſuch Communion ſhall perſuade the Pariſh-Churches, that their Frame is <hi>eligible,</hi> and not only <hi>tolerable;</hi> that they are <hi>righteous,</hi> and <hi>need no repentance; pure,</hi> as well as <hi>true Churches of Christ,</hi> and need no Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. 2. When that Communion ſhall be ſo managed, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons communicating muſt be obliged to ſeparate from all other Churches, which they judge to be of a purer mold, and wherein they may enjoy all Chriſt's Ordinances with much greater, and clearer ſatisfaction to their Conſciences, and more notable advantages for edification. 3. When ſuch Communion ſhall viſibly harden the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in their ſuperſtitious uſages; As <hi>kneeling at the Sacrament, bowing before Altars, Churches, the East,</hi> and at the word <hi>Jeſus,</hi> has apparently done; and ſo much <hi>T.G.</hi> the Doctor's grand Antagoniſt, has profeſſed in his Diſpute about Idolatry. 4. When ſuch Communion and Conformity ſhall notably prejudice the Chriſtian Religion in general; and that this would have been the effect of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Conformity, was well expreſs'd by a <hi>Conformable Miniſter</hi> of good Note in the Church, who told his Friend, a Captain in His Majeſties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>That he was heartily glad that ſo many Miniſters had refus'd to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form upon the Terms propoſed.</hi> And being ask'd with ſome wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a reaſon of his ſtrange expreſſion, he anſwer'd thus: (Not that thereby they had more good Livings to ſcramble for, as one anſwer'd;) <hi>Had all Conform'd, the People would have thought there had been nothing in Religion; that it had been onely a thing to talk of in the Pulpit, to ſerve a State deſign; but now by throwing up their Livings, and expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and Families to outward ruine, rather than Conform to the things impoſed, not agreeable (as they apprehend) to the Goſpel they had preached, they have convinced the world, there is a Reality in Religion, and thereby given a check to Atheiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſhut up this Diſcourſe; If the Doctor would have us Conform <hi>as far as we judge it lawful,</hi> when ſuch Compliance is cloathed with all its particular circumſtances, we are willing to it, provided the Doctor can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us, that ſuch Compliance ſhall be accepted in full ſatisfaction of the debt. But we doubt it muſt not be the <hi>Dean of St.</hi> Paul's, but <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> there, that muſt aſſign the Limits, Bounds, Terms and Meaſures of our Conformity. If hearing a Sermon, as we have occaſion, and going as much further as Conſcience warranted by the Word will permit us, would excuſe us from being reviled, and railed at as Schiſmaticks, Rebels, Traytors, and what not, would do it, it would be done, nay, it is done; but if he has no Commiſſion to treat with us, and compound the matter, I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49933:37"/>
fear he has ſpoiled the Wit and Ingenuity of his late Allegory, and fought a Skirmiſh without the Command of his General; for though he ſtand upon very high Ground, he ſtands not as yet on the higheſt, and <hi>there are higher than he.</hi>

                  <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> The Grounds of the preſent Separation, aſſigned by the Doctor, Examined and Cleared.</head>
               <p>THE main Queſtion, ſo ſolemnly propounded by the Reverend Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, having given us the ſlip, we are entertained with another; <hi>What are the Grounds of the preſent Separation?</hi> and the utmoſt he can find in the beſt Writers of the ſeveral Parties amounts but to theſe two;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That although they are in a State of Separation from the Church, yet this Separation is not Schiſm.</hi> And he courteouſly ſuppoſes them to have <hi>one Reaſon</hi> for this Principle, from the Author of <hi>Evangelical Love,</hi> p. 68. <hi>Our Lord</hi> Chriſt <hi>Inſtituted only Congregational Churches, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Aſlemblies for Divine Worſhip, which having the ſole Church-power in themſelves, they are under no Obligation of Communion with other Churches, but only to preſerve Peace and Charity with them;</hi> and from the Author of <hi>The true and only way of Concord.</hi> p. 111. <hi>That to deviſe</hi> new Species of Churches <hi>(beyond Parochial, or Congregational) without God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to impoſe them on the World (yea in his Name) and call all Diſſenters Schiſmaticks, is a far worſe uſurpation than to make and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe new Ceremonies.</hi> This is all the reaſon the Doctor can find to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Separation to be no Sin: But does the vaſt weight of their Cauſe hang upon one ſingle ſtring? I can ſhew him where he may find more aſſigned by the Author of <hi>Evangelical Love,</hi> whom he quotes. 1. <hi>That there are many things in all Parochial Churches that openly ſtand in need of Reformation, which theſe Parochial Churches neither do, nor can, nor have power to Reform.</hi> And who would joyn with them, that have no power to Reform themſelves? 2. <hi>Many things in the conſtant total Communion of Parochial Churches are impoſed on the Conſciences and Practices of men, which are not aceording to the mind of</hi> Chriſt. And will <hi>Christ</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them for Schiſmaticks, who are ready to come up to his Commands, becauſe they dare advance no further? 3. That <hi>there is no Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church-Diſcipline adminiſtred in ſuch Parochial Churches, which yet is a neceſſary means unto the Edification of the Churches appointed by Christ
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49933:38"/>
himſelf.</hi> And are they Schiſmaticks who ſeparate not from, but to, any of Chriſt's means for their Edification? 4. <hi>The Rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſuch Parochial Churches are under (in the room of that which ought to be in and among themſelves)</hi> viz. <hi>by Biſhops-Courts, Chancellors, Commiſſaries, is unknown to the Scriptures:</hi> And are they Schiſmaticks who refuſe an unſcriptural, for a Scriptural Rule and Government? 5. <hi>There is a total Deprivation of the Peoples Liberty to chuſe their own Paſtors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are deprived of all uſe of their Light and Knowledge, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for their own Edification.</hi> And it's hard that men ſhall be made Schiſmaticks becauſe they would uſe their Reaſons: that is, unleſs they will be ſomething <hi>worſe than Men,</hi> they cannot be <hi>good Chriſtians.</hi> 6. That <hi>there is a want of due means of Edification in many of thoſe Parochial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and yet none ſhall be allowed to provide themſelves better.</hi> And is it not very ſevere, for Chriſtians to be Damned, becauſe they would be more certainly and eaſily Saved? Thus then we ſee there are other, many other, Reaſons alledged to juſtifie ſuch Separation to be no Schiſm, though it pleaſed the Doctor to wink at them, and Aſſign only this one, which yet it's well if he can Confute.</p>
               <p>In order to which He thinks, That <hi>to clear the practice of Separation from being a Sin, two things are neceſſary to be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">§ 1. <hi>To prove that a Chriſtian has no obligation to external Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion beyond a Congregational Church.</hi> And is this the Duty incumbent upon them? They think they have done enough if they prove there's an Obligation lies upon them to hold external Communion in that Church whereof they are Members; and let others prove that they are obliged to Communion beyond thoſe Bounds: If the Diſſenters enlarge their Communion as far as Chriſt enlarged the Churches, let them who have enlarged the Bounds of the Churches prove it to be the Diſſenters duty to widen their Communion to that Latitude. It's ſufficient if they that hold this Principle can juſtifie it without confuting other mens Notions; and they Judge their own Principle and Practice ſufficiently authoriſed from this one thing. Their Doctrine, Communion, and Ordinances have the ſame extent with thoſe of the firſt Chriſtians. Acts 2.42. <hi>Who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, breaking Bread, and Prayer.</hi> And let the oppoſers prove that any larger extent of Churches, than what anſwers theſe ends, is neceſſary, and they are ready to Conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it.</p>
               <p>What the Doctor hath to ſay, or however what he hath ſaid, will fall under theſe heads. (1.) <hi>I have never ſeen any tolerable Proof that the Churches Planted by the Apoſtles were limited to Congregations:</hi> To which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49933:38"/>
more needs not be ſaid than that, 1. If the Churches planted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were <hi>in ſuch Congregations;</hi> it's no matter to us whether they were <hi>limited</hi> to ſuch Congregations or no: If Congregational bounds be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, let other and larger bounds be proved by them that are concern'd to juſtifie them. 2. If ſuch particular Churches were not of Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; then it would be no Schiſm to ſeparate from them: I ſay no Schiſm of Chriſt's condemning, and if others will make other Notions of Schiſm, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles never knew, and ſo multiply ſin without cauſe, let them contrive a hell too wherein thoſe ſins, and ſchiſms ſhall be puniſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The Doctor proceeds, <hi>It's poſſible at firſt there might be no more Chriſtians in one City, than could meet in one aſſembly for worſhip; but where doth it appear, that when they multiplied into more Congregations, they did make new and diſtinct officers, with a ſeparate power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> I confeſs I know not where any ſuch thing appears, that they made <hi>new and diſtinct Churches;</hi> that is, <hi>ſpecifically new,</hi> of <hi>another kind, ſort, or ſpecies;</hi> but that they did make <hi>other Churches, and other Officers,</hi> that is, <hi>more Churches, and more Officers,</hi> is made appear thus; that if they had not ſuch Officers, their aſſemblies had not anſwered their ends; and if they had not the <hi>ſame power of Government</hi> that the other Churches had, they had not been of the ſame kind, but quite another thing; but what it does not appear the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, it appears abundantly, the ſucceeding corrupter times have done, even to form <hi>new Churches, new Officers</hi> wholly diſtinct from thoſe inſtituted by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and hence it was, that to keep Peace as is pretended amongſt the Paſtors of particular Churches, they found out <hi>a Biſhop,</hi> and to keep the Biſhops from falling together by the ears, they invented an <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Metropolitans might poſſibly quarrel, they inſtituted a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> and becauſe the Patriarchs were ſubject to the ſame paſſions with other men, prudence contrived a <hi>Pope,</hi> and clapt him upon them all, to keep them in <hi>Decorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) The Doctor thinks <hi>it will not appear credible to any conſiderate man, that the</hi> 5000 <hi>in the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>made one ſtated and fixed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation for divine worſhip.</hi> Things are credible or incredible, as ſome mens intereſts, and occaſions will have them, or elſe it were no ſuch hard matter to make it credible to the Doctor, that 5000, 10000, 20000, might make one ſtated and fixt Congregation for worſhip; he has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it in St. <hi>Andrews Holborn,</hi> a place which he has cauſe to know contains more than 5000, and yet they have but <hi>one ſtated, fixed Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation for divine worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:49933:39"/>(4) The Doctor thinks that <hi>much more may be ſaid for lim ting Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to private families, than to particular Congregations:</hi> Let us hear it then! <hi>Do we not read of the Church in the houſe of</hi> Priſcilla and Aquila? <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.3, 5. <hi>and of the Church that was in the houſe of</hi> Nymphas <hi>at</hi> Coloſs? <hi>Col.</hi> 4.15. <hi>and in the houſe of</hi> Philemon <hi>in</hi> Laodicea? <hi>Philem.</hi> 2, 3. yes! we do ſo, and yet hear nothing to the purpoſe; for a Church may be <hi>in a houſe,</hi> and yet not compoſed of that <hi>houſe:</hi> A Church may meet <hi>in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> when it conſiſts of <hi>more than the family;</hi> A Church of Diſſenters may poſſibly meet <hi>in a houſe,</hi> and yet if one of the eccleſiaſtick <hi>Setters,</hi> ſhould get them in the wind, and inform againſt them, that they were there <hi>aſſembled for the worſhip of God, with above the number of four be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the family,</hi> I fear, A Plea, that they that meet <hi>in a family</hi> are <hi>of the family,</hi> would hardly prevent a Conviction.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) Again the Doctor argues thus, <hi>If notwithſtanding ſuch plain exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, men will extend Churches to Congregations of many families, why may not others extend them to thoſe ſocieties which conſiſt of many Congregations?</hi> I will tell him why, 1. Becauſe his <hi>plain examples</hi> are <hi>plain miſtakes,</hi> nor can he give one inſtance of a Church that conſiſted of a <hi>family, becauſe it was a family.</hi> 2. We read of Churches of <hi>many families;</hi> but of none compoſed of <hi>many particular Churches:</hi> Many families have warrant to unite into a Church (not <hi>as families,</hi> but as the individuals are duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified) in order to the great ends of worſhip, edification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>many Churches</hi> have no ſuch warrant to unite for the deſtruction of thoſe ends, or any one of them; And it is the end, and the uſefulneſs of unity for that end which muſt regulate, and determine the Union. It is very lawful to build a Ship or Man of war as big as two or three Yachts, which may do better ſervice, but it's folly to make one that would reach from <hi>Calice</hi> to <hi>Dover</hi> which muſt lie like an uſeleſs Log, unmeet for ſailing, and the ends for which all Ships are built; but let the Doctor extend the name of Church as far as he pleaſes, to the worlds end, or as far as the <hi>Rules of the Kings bench</hi> have been extended, we are unconcern'd ſo long as this is clear, that how far ſoever men may extend Churches, name or thing, in Compliance with the extent of the civil government; yet the extent of our actual communion in worſhip, is no other than that of the Church of which we are by our own choice members.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) He goes on, <hi>Although when the Churches increaſed, the occaſional meetings were frequent in ſeveral places, yet ſtill there was but one Church, one Altar, one Baptiſtry, one Biſhop,</hi> which will utterly deſtroy either <hi>parochial or Dioceſan</hi> Churches: For if <hi>one Baptiſtry,</hi> and <hi>one Church</hi> be of the ſame extent, what will become of the <hi>Dioceſan Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:49933:39"/>
in which there are hundred of thoſe <hi>Baptiſtries,</hi> and but <hi>one Biſhop?</hi> and <hi>if one Biſhop, and one Church,</hi> be of the ſame extent, what will become of the <hi>Parochials,</hi> where there is <hi>one Baptiſtry</hi> indeed, but not <hi>one Biſhop?</hi> And it ſeems very evident, that in the beginning of Chriſtianity, a Church was no larger a Body than could aſſemble in one place for all the ends of a Chriſtian Society; ſo the Apoſtle ſuppoſes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18. when ye come together <hi>in the Church,</hi> compar'd with <hi>ver.</hi> 20. when ye come together <hi>into one place,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> where to meet <hi>in the Church,</hi> and to meet <hi>in one place,</hi> are phraſes of equal Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and ſo <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> Edit. Voſſ. p. 20 <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
i. e. <hi>If the Prayer of one or two Chriſtians hath ſuch power, how much greater efficacy hath that of the Biſhop, and the whole Church? he therefore that cometh not to that place,</hi> (or that Congregation) <hi>is already proud, and hath condemned himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto the Doctor has endeavor'd to overthrow the Principle, which ſeeing he cannot do, he comes to ſuppoſe, or grant it, yet withal denying that from thence any thing can be drawn that will juſtifie Separation.</p>
               <p n="1">§ 1. <hi>Suppoſe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that the first Churches, by reaſon of the ſmall numbers of Believers at that time, were Congregational, yet what obligation lies upon us to diſturb the Peace of the Church we live in, to reduce Churches to their infant ſtate?</hi> To which I anſwer, <hi>none at all;</hi> we know no ſuch obligation lies upon us, and do wiſh that they (ſuppoſing the Church to be <hi>Metropolitical,</hi> or <hi>National</hi>) did ſee <hi>no more obligation lying upon them to diſturb the Peace of the Churches that we live in,</hi> to reduce all to their overgrown ſtate; we are for our own liberty, without infringing theirs; but it's common to complain of other mens unpeaceableneſs, who will have peace with none but themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. <hi>They do not think it neceſſary</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to introduce the first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of goods, which was far more certainly practiſed than Congregational Churches, nor to waſh one anothers feet, though Chriſt did it, and bad his Diſciples do as he did.</hi> I anſwer, 1. For <hi>Community of Goods,</hi> I dare ſay I ſhall convince the Doctor it was no obliging example, for he has no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to become a <hi>Leveller,</hi> and would loſe more than he could hope to gain by putting all the Benefices of the Land into <hi>Hotchpot.</hi> For, there was never any ſuch <hi>command or practice for the promiſcuous uſe</hi> of all outward things, without the free conſent of individual Chriſtians; Propriety was not then deſtroyed, but each Chriſtian was the Proprietor of his Eſtate; the great exigency of the Church did invite to a very liberal and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49933:40"/>
meaſure of charitable contribution to the neceſſity of the Saints, but ſtill it was voluntary, and no otherwiſe forced than by Arguments. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.4- <hi>While it remained, was it not thy own? and after it was ſold, was it not in thy power?</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Their Charity did not deſtroy Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And if the ſame diſtreſs ſhould again overtake any particular Church as that was, it would be as much the duty of the Rich, to extend their Benevolence to the neceſſity of their poor Brethren as then it was, or could be. 2. For his inſtance of Chriſt's <hi>waſhing his Diſciples Feet,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them <hi>to do as he did.</hi> What perſon that reads the Scripture, does not obſerve that it was not the <hi>waſhing the Feet</hi> that was commanded, but that mutual deference, reciprocal ſerving of each other, avoiding of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious encroaching of one over another, when Chriſt had made them Equals: this was the great Point Chriſt would inſtruct them in by that temporary Ceremony. For ſo it is commanded, that we lift up <hi>pure hands</hi> without wrath and doubting, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. when yet none ever ſtood ſo ſuperſtitiouſly upon't, that every man is bound to <hi>lift up his hands in Prayer:</hi> but the Duty was purity of the whole man. Two things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are in this reaſoning, which would be better cleared, 1. That there is no more neceſſity for the worſhip of God in particular Aſſemblies, at all times, under all conditions of the Church, than there was for the <hi>Community of Goods,</hi> in that extraordinary exigence of the Church at that time. 2. That Propriety of our Eſtates, and the right of our particular Churches to worſhip God, muſt give way to National Church Frames, in both which we have ſome cauſe to be tender, and not to part with them till we receive better Arguments.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. The Doctor reaſons thus with us: <hi>They believe that the first Civil Government was appointed by God himſelf over all Families, do they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think themſelves bound to overthrow Kingdoms, to bring things back to their firſt inſtitution? if not, why ſhall the Peace of the Church be in ſo much worſe a condition than that of the Civil State?</hi> To which the Anſwer is very plain, 1. We look upon our ſelves under no obligation to <hi>diſturb,</hi> much leſs to <hi>deſtroy Kingdoms,</hi> or any kind of Government whatever, to reduce things to their firſt inſtitution, nor is there any need of it, to deſtroy the Civil Government, by reducing the Church to ſuch a poſture, as will anſwer the great deſigns of Religion. 2.

confeſs that his Inſtance is parallel, his Argument from thence cogent, and ſuch as will cut aſunder the Nerves of our Anſwer; when the wiſe God did inſtitute National Civil Government, yet be reſerved entire to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Families their authority over Servants and Children, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in their Eſtates; but how will this juſtifie ſuch a National Church-Government, as deſtroys the inherent power of the Paſtors of particular Churches, making them only <hi>ſhadows</hi> of the primitive Paſtoral Authority, (if ſhadows) and leaving them onely the <hi>bare Name</hi> (if the Name) of Paſtors, without any power inherent in them, to govern the Churches, <hi>over which the Holy Ghost hath made them Overſeers.</hi>

And then it will be uncertain alſo whether the Parochial Miniſters be true Miniſters of Chriſt; for if there be no certainty of the Divine Right of particular Congregations, there can be as little of certainty, That there is any Divine Authority given to the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them. And 5. It will be uncertain whether God will be ſolemnly and publickly Worſhipped; for where can he ſo be, but in particular Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies?

               <p n="5">§ 5. He argues further to this purpoſe; <hi>It's certainly our Duty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Peace and Unity among Chriſtians, and it's impoſſible ſo to do if Men break all orders in Pieces for the fancy they have taken up of a Primitive Platform.</hi> It's well there is ſomething <hi>Certain,</hi> though it's hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how we ſhould preſerve Peace, if it be uncertain in what we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to unite and agree: It's the <hi>Unity of the Spirit</hi> that will be kept in the <hi>Bond of Peace:</hi> Peace is the Bond of the Churches, but there muſt be firſt conceived a <hi>Church,</hi> which Peace is to bind: There muſt be a Vineyard,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49933:41"/>
or to what purpoſe a Hedge? a City, or to what purpoſe a Wall or Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark? More particularly, 1. As it is the Duty of all Men to preſerve the Churches Peace, ſo 'tis theirs eſpecially who have got the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things in their hands, not to lay ſuch dubious Terms in the way of Peace which they know many Conſciencious perſons cannot get over, but have ever ſtumbled at; for it may be returned with eaſe, <hi>It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to preſerve Peace if wen will make ſuch Orders as they know others muſt break, meerly for the fancy they have taken up of a Primitive Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</hi> 2. If Peace be impoſſible to be had upon this account, who are in the fault? Diſſenters can maintain a fraternal Charity towards them and their Churches, who differ from them in Principle and Practice, if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers cannot, or will not diſcharge that Duty reciprocally, we are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for their Paſſions; we can love them whether they will or no, though we cannot force them againſt their will to return that Love and Charity. 3. But muſt Peace be extended no farther than local and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Communion? or muſt the Pariſhes of St. <hi>Andrews, Sepulchers,</hi> and St. <hi>Giles</hi> go together by the ears, becauſe one Church will not hold the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth part of them? I can hold and maintain <hi>Peace</hi> with the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> and yet I never intend actual Communion with it, unleſs ſhe were much more Reformed from all her Corruptions, than ſhe is like to be in haſte. There may be ſuch Corruptions in a Church as may <hi>defile it,</hi> and yet not <hi>un-Church</hi> it. I can diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and their <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> on one hand, and the <hi>Pollutions</hi> wherewith they have aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Chriſtianity, on the other.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6 But to this the Doctor Anſwers, <hi>Men may pleaſe themſelves in talking of preſerving Peace and Love under ſeparate Communions, but our own ſad experience ſhews the contrary.</hi> This is the upſhot of his Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>There can be no Peace under ſeparate Communions,</hi> which I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by asking a few ſober queſtions, which will lead to their reſpective Anſwers. 1. Whether by ſeparate Communion, he intends only ſuch as is <hi>Locally ſeparate?</hi> if ſo, <hi>joyful Experience ſhews us the contrary;</hi> we have no <hi>Bellum Parochiale,</hi> nor are like to have, could they ſecure us as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a <hi>Bellum Epiſcopale.</hi> 2. Does he, by <hi>Separated Communion,</hi> intend ſuch as differ only in ſome external Modes? How then do the Countrey Villages agree ſo well with the <hi>Cathedral Mother-Churches?</hi> It's certain that the Cathedral Service, and that of the under Pariſhes, differ ſo much, that a poor Countrey-man dropping in by chance into the Worſhip would be half affrighted out of his Wits, ſuch a Ditty, ſuch a Din, with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Choriſters, Singing-men, and Boys, that from the <hi>uncertain Sound</hi> and confuſed noiſe, the poor Fellow would not know what was <hi>Piped</hi> or

                  <hi>Tooted:</hi> ſo a grave Alderman in the days of <hi>Yore,</hi> going out with the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-hunt,</hi> and being askt if he did not feel a tranſport and extaſie of ſoul at the raviſhing muſick of the hounds, proteſted he could not hear any muſick at all for the barking of thoſe yelping Curs; but come into the Country, we have nothing there but bad Rhimes ſet to as bad tunes, and worſe ſung; In the one you have turning hither, faceing thither, ſuch ducking, dopping, bending, bowing, cringing, changing of poſtures, that the poor country man begins to queſtion whether it be the ſame God that they and he worſhip; and if it be, he's amazed that God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their rude homeſpun devotions, when he has ſuch glorious ſervice, ſuch ſplendid, pompous worſhip in other places; and yet we do not ſee that they come to knocking: If then theſe two ſorts can live peaceably, and lovingly together, the one not <hi>deſpiſing</hi> the ruſticity of the high-ſhoe devotions; the other not <hi>judging</hi> of, envying at, or grudging againſt, their more ſtately ſhows and pageants; why will they quarrel with the plain diſſenters whoſe only fault is that, though their worſhip is not well trimmed up with ceremonious ribons, 'tis of as ſtrong ſtuff, will laſt as long, and keep the wearer as warm as the other? 3. Whereas the Doctor fancies that this will alienate mens affections: The remedy is to preach down paſſion, pride, cenſoriouſneſs, and thoſe baſe luſts, which would produce the <hi>ſame effects,</hi> if all men were of <hi>one Communion:</hi> If one will be angry becauſe another mans Noſe is longer than his own, he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain his anger, for the other cannot help the longitude of his Noſe, nor give it one degree leſs of elevation. Let them puniſh or otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain thoſe incendiaries, who by their hot, and fiery tempers, will ſuffer none to be cool, that are in themſelves of a more winterly temper: Let them curb ſuch preachers, as the Author of <hi>Curſe ye Meroz,</hi> who did enough to have kindled a greater fire at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> than that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun at <hi>Pudding-Lane:</hi> The diſeaſe lies in mens minds, and when they would heal the outward Symptom, 'tis but like him that applied the <hi>plaiſter to the wrong finger,</hi> and then complained of his plaiſter.

               <p>Theſe continual beatings of the Doctor and ſome others upon <hi>Peace,</hi> mind me of what I have ſomewhere or other, ſeen or read, of a great Gentleman who courted a Lady of no leſs virtue than Beauty, and ſuch an <hi>Inamorato</hi> was he grown, that he became exceedingly melancholly, his folded armes, his hat plukt in's eyes, retiredneſs from all company witneſſed great diſtreſs; at laſt he came to a reſolution, that ſeeing he could not win her affections, he would die a Sacrifice in the flame of his

               <p>HItherto the Doctor's reaſonings againſt that principle, <hi>that there is a ſeparation, but yet the ſeparation is no Schiſm,</hi> have fallen under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. He proceeds now to that of <hi>ſome others,</hi> who <hi>confeſs</hi> (as he ſays) <hi>That to live in a ſtate of ſeparation from ſuch Churches, as many at leaſt</hi> of ours are, is a ſin: what myſtery may there be in the phraſe of <hi>living in a ſtate of ſeparation,</hi> I am not well aware of, and therefore cannot prevent what miſcheif may be deſign'd againſt us by it: Of a <hi>State of Nature, and a ſtate of Grace,</hi> we have read in old <hi>Proteſtant Authors,</hi> but now adays all the outcry is againſt this <hi>ſtate of ſeparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Doctor informs us, that the men of this Plea, deny that they live in a <hi>ſtate of ſeparation, although they preach when, and where it is forbidden by law, and worſhip God, and adminiſter Sacraments by other Rules, and after a different manner than what our Church requires. They own ſeparation to be ſinful, and have no other Refuge left but to deny the fact, which is evident to all perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the general I ſhall only ſay, that the principles and pleading of theſe whom the Doctor would make two parties, are really and indeed <hi>but one and the ſame;</hi> only they have made uſe of other expreſſions to declare their minds: They that ſay <hi>ſeparation is lawful,</hi> take the word only for a withdrawing from the Communion of a Church, when they have good reaſons to juſtifie their departure: They that ſay <hi>ſeparation is ſinful,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:49933:42"/>
take the word in an evil ſenſe, as denoting a departure from a Church out of humour, Levity, or ſome worſe principle, as hatred of, oppoſition to thoſe Churches from which they withdraw. And this he might have ſeen in thoſe very words he quoted from the <hi>Author of Concord. Cauſeleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Communion with true Churches is Schiſm, eſpecially if it be joyned with ſetting up Anti-Churches unwarrantably againſt them.</hi> Now how many things muſt concur to make ſeparation culpable, according to the tenor of theſe words, I can hardly reckon up. 1. It muſt be ſeparation <hi>without cauſe,</hi> from a true Church. Now the Doctor himſelf will allow that there may be a <hi>juſt cauſe of ſeparation from a true Church.</hi> 2. It muſt be <hi>renouncing communion;</hi> but though theſe men ſuſpend, or forbear Communion for a while, yet when the Church ſhall return to herſelf, and abate of her rigors, they carry in their breaſts <hi>Animum revertendi,</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to return again. 3. It muſt be ſetting up <hi>Churches againſt Churches,</hi> not one <hi>beſides another,</hi> to carry on the common cauſe of Religion againſt Atheiſts, Hereticks, Infidels, prophane perſons, and all the debauchees both in faith, and manners. And, 4. all this muſt be done in an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable manner;</hi> the circumſtances muſt be ſuch as croſs the general rules of the Goſpel, and if all theſe be found in any ſeparation, let it be doomed and condemned for ſchiſm, and ſinful. I wonder therefore with what ſincerity the Doctor could ſay, <hi>They own the thing to be ſinful, and yet deny the fact:</hi> Whereas that which they confeſs to be ſinful in the Rule or Principle; that only they deny themſelves to have done in fact: And what they confeſs themſelves to have done, they never confeſſed to be ſinful. <hi>There is a ſeparation that is ſinful,</hi> this ſay they we never practiſed: <hi>And there is a ſeparation too that is lawful;</hi> and here they own the fact, and deny the ſinfulneſs of it: Theſe tricks therefore will never ſatisfie his Auditors, nor his Readers; but the Doctor's great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and ſmoothneſs of his Style, and a notable talent to miſrepreſent his adverſaries, have made very mean and ordinary Diſcourſes paſs for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perexcellent, and his name being up he may lie-abed till noon: for ſo have I heard ſomewhere of a Cutler's boy that was making a knife, and unluckily the ſteel fell off when he had welded it; No matter! no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! Let it go boy, ſaid (the Maſter) my name's up, and my Iron will ſell, though not cut better, than other mens Steel. And now for a more particular return.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They confeſs,</hi> that they (three months ago, you muſt underſtand that we come not within the ſtatute) <hi>preach when, and where it was forbidden by law,</hi> and they have a cauſe for it: Becauſe they can preach <hi>no where, nor time elſe,</hi> without ſuch conditions as they judge are, and think they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49933:43"/>
have proved unlawful; but they ſay, that to preach when <hi>forbidden by Law,</hi> is not <hi>always ſinful:</hi> For ſo did the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, even when their Commiſſion was not vouched by Miracles, till 300 years after Chriſt. And if it be ſaid, that it is ſinful in our caſe, that muſt be tryed out by no general Arguments and Reaſons, but ſuch as are ſpecial and proper to the caſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They confeſs they do worſhip God, and adminiſter Sacraments, by other Rules, and in other manner than what the preſent Church preſcribes.</hi> If the Diſſenters do all this by other Rules, and in other manner than the Aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do, it will follow unavoidably, that the Aſſenters do them by other Rules, and in other manner than the Diſſenters do; which is the worſt that I know will follow, unleſs he can prove that the Rules by which they worſhip God, the manner in which they adminiſter Sacraments are nearer then, or as near the Rule and Preſcript of the Word, as thoſe of the Diſſenters: So that the Queſtion muſt come to this at laſt, Whether thoſe Rules <hi>by which,</hi> that manner <hi>after which,</hi> the Church requires to worſhip God, and adminiſter Sacraments, be conformable to the Scripture Rule of Worſhip, the Scripture manner of Adminiſtration? for if they be, then theſe Diſſenters flatly affirm, That they worſhip God, they admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacraments by <hi>no other Rule,</hi> in <hi>no other manner,</hi> than what the Church preſcribes. But if they be not, then they ſay, If they in all their ways of Worſhip Conform to the <hi>Canonical</hi> Rules, though they do ſwerve a little from ſuch as are <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> they hope, and believe God will acquit them, as their Conſciences now do of the guilt of Schiſm; and if others will not, 'tis not ſo much material, becauſe they ſhall not receive their final doom from the Churches mouth, nor be tryed by her Rules, when they come to be tryed for their All. And by this time we ſee, and ſo may the Doctor, how much better it had been for him to have follow'd his <hi>Text,</hi> and not to gather Doctrines thence, which never grew there; nor to have ſo confidently aſſerted, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. <hi>The neceſſity of one fixed and certain Rule, notwithſtanding the different attainments amongſt Chriſtians,</hi> unleſs he could have proved it more ſolidly, of <hi>ſuch Rules</hi> as Churches make, not contained in the general Rules of the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is the Doctor in good earneſt? On is this Rhetorick <hi>pro formâ tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm?</hi> Will worſhiping God by <hi>other Rules,</hi> and in <hi>other modes and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> than a Church requires, make ſuch Worſhip Schiſmatical? then mark the fatal conſequences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's then apparent, that moſt of the Parochial Churches in <hi>England,</hi> are <hi>Schiſmatical Churches;</hi> for do not they worſhip by <hi>other Rules,</hi> and in <hi>other manner</hi> than the Church preſcribes? where is the preſcribed Rule
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49933:43"/>
for ſinging Pſalms in <hi>Hopkins</hi>'s and <hi>Sternhold</hi>'s Metre? which yet is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally practiſed in moſt Pariſhes that I have heard of. The Title Page of the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> tells us there are contained in it, <hi>the Pſalms pointed as they are to be ſaid or ſung;</hi> but what Pariſhes ſing according to thoſe Interpunctations? The end of the Book tells us, <hi>Here the Morning Prayer is ended;</hi> and, <hi>Here the Evening Prayer is ended:</hi> And yet when the Church has ended, the Pariſhes begin, and ſet up their Notes in thoſe Metrical Verſions. Again, what Rule have we for <hi>bowing towards the Altar? the East? the Church?</hi> And yet theſe modes and manners of worſhiping God are commonly practiſed. Are all thoſe Pariſh-Churches which are got into the garb and equipage of the Cathedrals, with Organs, Choriſters, and the like, Schiſmatical or no? If not: Then to worſhip God in another mode than what is preſcribed by the Church, may not be Schiſmatical Worſhip; but if it be ſo, then are thoſe Churches Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, and how then can it be Schiſm to ſeparate from them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will follow alſo, (there's no remedy for it) that either the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Churches, or the Cathedral, are Schiſmatical Churches; for the former are as much below the ſplendor of the latter, as the latter are above the ruſticity of the former. If there be <hi>two Rules,</hi> one for the mode of Cathedral Worſhip, another for that of the private Pariſhes, let them but allow half as much diverſity to the Diſſenters, and all the pother and duſt, and clamor of Schiſm will be over.</p>
               <p>I would therefore propound one modeſt Queſtion, Why is this practice of ſinging <hi>Hopkins</hi>'s Metre ſo univerſally practiſed, and yet ſo little or not at all preach'd againſt in the Pulpits? <hi>Is it for fear they ſhould have none left to preach to? That is not to be imagined of conſcientious and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified men!</hi> Though it's true, <hi>Engliſh Men,</hi> they ſay, are like your <hi>Iriſh Cows,</hi> that will not give down their milk kindly, except their Calves ſtand by; or however, to humor them, the Calves skin ſtuft with ſtraw: <hi>Or is it lest they ſhould ſeem to condemn themſelves, that make Diſſenters Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, for that very thing which they themſelves practiſe? This looks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what oddly, I confeſs, and the tenderneſs of a man's mind in ſuch a caſe, may, out of meer ſhame-facedneſs, keep him from declaring a Truth which flies in his face while he ſpeaks it.</hi> What can it then be? <hi>Do they fear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the People?</hi> I will not determine, but by asking the Doctor his own Queſtion, <hi>How comes it to be Schiſmatical in ſome, and lawful in others?</hi> Have they two weights and meaſures? Are the Diſſenters Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, for worſhiping God by <hi>other Rules;</hi> and the Pariſh-Churches pious Sons, who <hi>do the ſame thing?</hi> Or are they reſolved that all the World ſhall be Schiſmaticks beſides themſelves?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49933:44"/>But the Doctor has got a Notion in his head, that theſe men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to <hi>confeſs a Separation,</hi> and he gives us the reaſon of it, becauſe <hi>they have formerly condemned it with great ſeverity, and yet they do the ſame things for which they charg'd others as guilty of a ſinful Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A heavy Charge! and wants nothing but the old thing <hi>Proof.</hi> Is it not a wiſe courſe to pretend to give a Reaſon of nothing? To aſſign a cauſe of a thing, before it's clear that there is ſuch a thing in the World? To tell us why they are unwilling, before it appears they are unwilling? <hi>So far as they do Separate, they are willing to confeſs it;</hi> and would he have them confeſs more than the Truth againſt themſelves? They own that they do not locally hold Communion with all Pariſhes, at all times, in all the parts of Worſhip, and this they are ready to prove is not Schiſm, is not ſinful. They avow that they do hold Communion with ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in ſome Ordinances, at ſome times, and this, they ſay, will avoid the charge of a total Separation. They ſay, they <hi>never condemned that for Separation in others,</hi> which <hi>they practiſe</hi> themſelves. How will he evince this? Why he has ranſacked and rumaged all <hi>the Papers of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that paſt between the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and the <hi>Independents,</hi> and there he finds, <hi>That the Aſſembly of Divines urged their diſſenting Brethren to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their Rules of Church-Government, and charged them with Schiſm if they did it not.</hi> Well, what then? Were <hi>the Rules</hi> propoſed by the Aſſembly the ſame with theſe that are urged now? Were they of the ſame nature? doubtfulneſs? difficulty? What if it was not the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> but a <hi>Committee,</hi> a <hi>Sub-Committee,</hi> or a <hi>Subter-Sub-Committee</hi> of the Aſſembly? What if it was not the final judgment of the Aſſembly, but the private opinion of that Sub-Committee? And what if we be no ways obliged to abide by their judgments or opinions? And what if the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> were too rigid, the other too ſtiff in their Sentiments, muſt the Church only imitate them in their weakneſſes, when they had ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies which deſerved imitation? And laſtly, what if the Doctor has miſreported the matter of Fact as there laid down? Any of theſe, much more all theſe will render the moſt plauſible part of his Sermon preached, or his Diſcourſe printed, manifeſtly impertinent. All which particulars, and many more, I ſhall make out from thoſe very Papers.</p>

               <p n="3">(3) The Committee, p. 19. render this Reaſon, why the deſire of their Brethren could not, <hi>in Terminis,</hi> be granted, <hi>Becauſe it held out a total Separation from the Rule, as if in nothing it were to be complied with, nor their Churches be Communicated with in any thing, which argued Church-Communion, and that more could not be done or ſaid against falſe Churches,</hi> wherein though they might be miſtaken, yet it ſhews upon what Reaſons they proceeded; but the Perſons againſt whom the Doctor diſputes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plead for, nor practice a <hi>total Separation,</hi> nor do any thing that may imply the <hi>Parrochial Churches</hi> to be <hi>falſe Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) The Committee, or Sub-Committee, had many things to urge, which the Doctor cannot make uſe of againſt the Diſſenters, as 1. <hi>That they were now endeavouring a further Reformation according to the Word of God;</hi> and therefore there was more ground for Hope, more reaſon for Patience to ſee what the Iſſue of their Conſultations might prove: And herein perhaps the Diſſenting Brethren might be a little too haſty and nimble with them; who knows but matters might have been adjuſted to their ſatisfaction? But things are much otherwiſe with us. For, 1. they are ſo far from Reforming according to the Word of God, that they own it not for a perfect Rule of Reformation. 2. They have taken up their Reſt, and will not proceed one Step farther, not to King <hi>Edward</hi>'s <hi>Beginning,</hi> nor Queen <hi>Elizabeths Beginning,</hi> much leſs to what Poſture things were in at <hi>Chriſt's Beginning.</hi> 3. When they had power in their hands, by His Majeſties Commiſſion, to have reformed the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> to have eaſed the People of their Burdens, they would not <hi>Abate an Ace</hi> of their Pretenſions, but rendred the Terms of Communion more ſevere and difficult. 4. The Pariſh Churches are meer <hi>Minors,</hi> and <hi>under Age,</hi> they move by the Motions of others, cannot Reform themſelves, but are ſtrictly tyed up to the Rubricks, Canons, and Conſtitutions of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, ſo that we have not the ſame Reaſon to hope for their Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49933:45"/>
of Worſhip according to the Word of God, 5. And yet this ſhall not be any prejudice to them, for if they ſhall do ſo, though it were to morrow, or a year, or ten years hence, we ſtand ready to fall in with ſuch Reformation: And farther, 2. the Committee did plead, That they had both of them Covenanted <hi>to endeavour the neareſt Conjunction,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for their Oaths ſake, were bound to part with as much of their Right as with a good Conſcience they could foregoe: But Diſſenters are under no ſuch Obligation, that they know of, to endeavour ſuch Conjunction with them who obtend their <hi>meer Wills</hi> to their <hi>Edification;</hi> and ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend farther, That they are under a <hi>Solemn Covenant to endeavour a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation according to the Word of God, in their reſpective places and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and therefore ought not to comply with any Declenſions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partures from ſuch Reformation.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) the Committee were willing, <hi>That ſome Expedient ſhould be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, how to bear with Diſſenters in the Particulars wherein they could not agree;</hi> But we ſee no ſuch expedient endeavoured after, nor once thought of, nay declared againſt, notwithſtanding the many <hi>Humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions for Peace</hi> that have been preſented to them, notwithſtanding <hi>His Majeſties Gracious Declaration about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs,</hi> and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Inclinations to ſhew ſome favour to tender Conſciences; nay they have declared againſt any Condeſcentions, and are daily provoking Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to the utmoſt Rigour, and are like the immovable Bank, to which if the Diſſenters will not wholly come over, the Boat and the Bank muſt never meet.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) Such was the tenderneſs of that Committee, that we find not ſo much in a dozen Convocations. For firſt they offer, <hi>That ſuch as, through ſcruple or error of Conſcience, cannot joyn to partake of the Lords Supper, ſhall repair to the Miniſter and Elders for ſatisfaction, which if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive, they ſhall not be compel'd to Communicate in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, provided that in all other parts of Worſhip</hi> (wherein there was an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement) <hi>they joyned with the Congregation.</hi> 2. They offer, p. 22. <hi>That ſuch as are under the Government of the Congregation where they live (not being Officers) ſhall ſeek ſatisfaction</hi> (as before) <hi>which if they cannot receive, they ſhall not be compel'd to be under the power of Cenſures from Claſſes or Synods, provided they continued under the Government of that Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi> How joyful at, how thankful for ſuch Moderation would thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of poor Engliſh-men be, if they might enjoy the Benefit of ſuch a Canon, to ſave their Perſons from a Priſon, their Eſtates from Ruine, and their Families from Deſolation!</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49933:45"/>(7) The Sub-Committee do readily acknowledge, <hi>That Schiſm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in every diverſity of Opinion and Practice, but in an open Breach of Love, and that no Uniformity is neceſſary to prevent Schiſm.</hi> p. 47. But the Doctor would make us believe, p. 32. <hi>That men may pleaſe themſelves in talking of Peace and Love under ſeparate Communions, but ſad Experience ſhews the contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">(8) The Committee, p. 48. think the Diſſenting Brethren wrong them, in ſaying <hi>That they make thoſe Impoſitions upon the people as quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications for receiving Sacraments,</hi> whenas <hi>they deſired no more than that the people appeared to be Orthodox:</hi> But certainly here's ſomething more than <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> required of us (even in the judgment of their own Teſt of <hi>Orthodoxy</hi>) as a qualification for receiving Sacraments; and we muſt Submit to the <hi>Sign of the Croſs</hi> in the one Sacrament for our Infants, and <hi>Kneeling</hi> in the other, as neceſſary to our own receiving them, when neither the one nor the other were mentioned by the <hi>Aſſembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">(9) The Committee expreſly declare, <hi>they would not have the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Brethren walk by their Rule farther than as they had attained:</hi> But the Doctor is for the Rule of Severity, waving the great Rule of Charity, <hi>notwithſtanding the different attainments of Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">(10) The Committee profeſs their Wonder (p. 49.) That <hi>their Brethren ſhould impute it to them, as if they arrogated to themſelves a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies to determine and impoſe circumſtantial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Seeing,</hi> ſay they, <hi>our Propoſition doth mention nothing but Agreement in Subſtance.</hi> But the Doctor ſuppoſing that we are agreed in the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials of Worſhip</hi> with him, yet preſſes us to come to the Churches Rules in thoſe things which they themſelves call Circumſtantials.</p>
               <p n="11">(11) The Committee, p. 49. deſires, <hi>That the matters of Offence may be particularly expreſſed,</hi> profeſſing <hi>their earneſt deſire, as much as in them lay, to remove whatever may hinder comfortable Communion, that there may be no juſt cauſe of Separation.</hi> But the preſent Diſſenters have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly expreſſed the matters of their Offence, and cannot obtain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of them, neither for Love nor Money; and it's a very hard World when neither of thoſe two Wedges will drive.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49933:46"/>(12) And they ſay farther, <hi>That the Honourable Houſes may find out more for Reformation than haply the Aſſembly have Adviſed, or themſelves yet concluded, ſo that they will be willing to be farther inſtructed in the things that belong to the Churches Peace.</hi> But our good Maſters have ſet up their <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Pillars, and Engraven on them <hi>Ne plus ultra,</hi> ſo that now Hope it ſelf is become hopeleſs, Patience worn to the Stumps, and all Endeavours out of breath; for after <hi>Cheeſe and Canon</hi> comes <hi>Nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">(13) Whatever the Altercations and Debates between the two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were in the Sub-Committee, yet the Reſolve, at laſt, (which is the main, if not only thing conſiderable) was this, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 15. <hi>Reſolved upon the queſtion, That they which agree in the ſubſtance of the Worſhip in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory according to the Preface, and agree in the Confeſſion of Faith, and with the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches, contained in their Confeſſions and writings, as we do, who differ from thoſe Brethren in matters of Diſcipline, ſhall have the benefit of the</hi> Indulgence.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, It may be a plauſible, but no righteous Method, to take the Arguments of the Committee, which were only concluſive in the Caſe before them (and perhaps not there) and to applie them to our preſent Caſe, which is quite another thing; And yet when all is ſaid that can be ſaid in this matter, it muſt be confeſſed there were undue heats and animoſities between the Brethren, both ſtanding too high upon their Pantables, which deſerves to be lamented, and not Imitated, and drawn into Argument and Example to juſtifie the inflexible Rigour of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Terms of Communion.</p>

               <p>THe Author of the Diſcourſe was very apprehenſive that the <hi>Context</hi> would be urged againſt his interpretation of the <hi>Text,</hi> and therefore to ſave us a labour he has from thence formed an objection for us againſt his own Doctrine, which we thankfully acknowledge, and accept; <hi>whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may be ſaid</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as to other Pleas, for their preſent practices, my Text</hi> (it ſhould have been the verſe before it) <hi>ſeems to afford the ſtrongeſt of all, that men are to be preſſed to go no further than they have already attained, and not to be ſtrained up to an Uniformity, beyond the dictates of their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> but to be let alone as the Apoſtle directs in the foregoing verſe, If any one be otherwiſe minded, <hi>he muſt be left to God, and that manifeſtation of his will, he will be pleaſed to give him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Objection to ſay truth is drawn up with as much integrity as we could well expect: For the Counſel for the <hi>Defendent</hi> is hardly to be truſted to draw up the declaration for the <hi>Plaintiff:</hi> One ſmall exception we have againſt his wording our Plea, and 'tis but a ſmall one: We ſay not, <hi>that men are not to be preſſed to go further than they have attained,</hi> provided they be only <hi>preſſed</hi> with ſuch Arguments as are proper for the conviction of Rational Creatures: For thus would our Bleſſed <hi>Savior</hi> have them preſſed, who was the grand exemplar of all moderation and meekneſs: <hi>Luke</hi> 14.23. <hi>Compel them to come in!</hi>

                  </gap>. And let tender Conſciences be thus compelled, and ſpare them not; we ſhall never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of this force, this violence: But there is a more ſavage and ferine Method of Compulſion, like that of the Gentleman who courteouſly invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his poor Tenants to a Chriſtmas dinner by a Bum-bailiff, and Tickets of green-wax, which <hi>filled his houſe</hi> indeed with gueſts, but ſpoiled all the mirth of the Feaſt: A Hawk will never make a good ſign for a Dove-Coat:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49933:47"/>
We would not have men <hi>preſſed</hi> and oppreſſed with <hi>Club-Logick,</hi> as a procedure unſuitable to the nature of Chriſtianity. And now we abide by the Objection; If God himſelf has given the <hi>Indulgence,</hi> what man has power <hi>to take off the Seal?</hi> or why ſhould the Church trouble it ſelf and others with doubtful Canons, when they that have <hi>not attained</hi> to ſatisfaction about them, have the condeſcenſion of God to plead for the ſuſpenſion of their own Acts, during ſuch diſſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Now this knot the Doctor will untie, or cut, or break. And the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>of it</hi> (he ſays) <hi>will give a full anſwer to the ſecond enquiry,</hi> viz. <hi>what is to be done if men cannot come up to the Rule preſcribed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is not this very much about and about the Buſh? why ſhould he give himſelf the needleſs trouble to enquire ſo ſcrupulouſly <hi>what is to be done in caſe men cannot come up to the Rule,</hi> when the Apoſtle has already given us a ſhort, but plain anſwer to it? namely, <hi>that they are to be left to God for farther inſtruction.</hi> But the Doctor is not ſatisfied with this Anſwer, and therefore he will <hi>anſwer it in theſe particulars:</hi> Anſwer it? yes, juſt as he did the former queſtion, by ſpeaking never a word to it. Had he been pleaſed to have anſwered the Queſtion <hi>what is to be done?</hi> he ſhould have reſolved us, firſt, <hi>What means are to be uſed to reclaim them that cannot come up?</hi> whether fair or fowl? Chriſtian or barbarous? whether corporal penalties are to be <hi>ſuſpended,</hi> or the Diſſenters? whether they are to be left in Gods hands, or taken into the Gaolers clutches? Secondly, <hi>By whom</hi> this muſt be <hi>done,</hi> that is to be done? as what <hi>they are to do</hi> who are diſſatisfied? what courſe they muſt take to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more knowledge of Gods mind and Will in that matter, that ſo they may enlarge their practice according to the improvement of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? Let it not then be ill taken if we put a few queſtions about this Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="1">I. What muſt <hi>they do,</hi> to whom <hi>a Rule</hi> is preſcribed by Men about their worſhiping of God, <hi>who cannot come up to it?</hi> And ſurely if pride and intereſt had not muddied it, the Anſwer had run very clear: They ought to examine and try that Rule by the word of God, to beg of him inſtruction in any point wherein they may poſſibly be <hi>otherwiſe minded</hi> than he would have them: And in the mean time to forbear, <hi>for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not of faith is ſin,</hi> that is, whatever a man <hi>does,</hi> and is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauded that it may be <hi>lawfully done.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That they had better ſit ſtill and <hi>do nothing,</hi> than riſe up, and <hi>do miſchief;</hi> Let 'em do no more harm than good, and let them be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That if they muſt need have more work <hi>to do,</hi> let 'em be ſure they have a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from God <hi>to do it,</hi> leſt while <hi>they do what they ought not to have done,</hi> and <hi>leave undone thoſe things they ought to have done,</hi> they make their ſins of <hi>Commiſſion</hi> greater than their ſins of <hi>Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="3">3. They may do well, among all their doings to conſider whether Conſcience be not Gods <hi>peculiar,</hi> and ſo not within their precincts; out of their juriſdiction, and not liable to their citations, proceſſes, ſummons, and viſitations; if they will judge, let 'em be ſure they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judges: if they will be buſie, let 'em beware it be not in <hi>Alieno foro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If they would know what they muſt <hi>do to others,</hi> let 'em firſt put the caſe what they would have <hi>done to themſelves?</hi> let them do no more at home, than they would have done to them ſuppoſing they were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spain.</hi> It's very uſeful now and then for great men to put themſelves into poor mens circumſtances; (I do not perſuade 'em to change places with them, but to put caſes) ſuppoſe our Biſhops had been in Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi>'s caſe when his nearer approach to the fire had thaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Epiſcopal Rigor, what would they have done? would they have magnified the mercy of their own mercileſs enemies for compelling them to <hi>walk farther than they had attained?</hi> or would they have called the Martyrs fools who upon their ordinary call preached the Goſpel, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the laws had ſilenced them?</p>
               <p n="3">III. It had been much in anſwer to our expectation, and the Queſtion, if he had pleaſed to have revealed the great ſecret, <hi>what this preſcribed Rule is?</hi> and this would have been more pertinent, than a diſcuſſion of the <hi>principle of individuation, is to the ſixth commandement.</hi> As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether this <hi>Rule</hi> be one preſcribed <hi>by God,</hi> it which caſe no mans ignorance will vacate the rule, though it incapacitate him at preſent to obey it; or <hi>by man,</hi> without direction and warrant from God, in which caſe, we need no ignorance to excuſe us, ſeeing power to command and obligation to obey, are Twins, both are born, live, and die toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:49933:48"/>2. Whether this <hi>preſcribed Rule,</hi> be ſuch as is ſubſervient to ſome other Rule preſcribed by God, or no way uſeful to that purpoſe? We freely grant, that whatever is neceſſary to reduce any Command of God into Act, and Exerciſe, may be, muſt be the matter of ſuch preſcribed Rules; whatever ſerves true decency and order, whatever tends to edification, to peace, or the glory of God, may be fit matter for a Rule, but rules about things no ways neceſſary to theſe ends, come not under humane determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Theſe things, or ſomewhat like theſe, might have offer'd at an Anſwer to the Queſtion; but let us hear the Doctor, who, the <hi>Reader</hi> muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, is not anſwering to the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> but to the <hi>Objection,</hi> which he would perſuade us will give a full Anſwer to the 2d <hi>Queſtion,</hi> but no man believes it.</p>
               <p n="1">§ 1. Then, <hi>This</hi> (ſays he) <hi>can never juſtifie men in not doing what they lawfully may do.</hi> This, What? why, <hi>that men are to be preſſed to go no farther than they have attained.</hi> This will <hi>not juſtifie</hi> men! I believe it will not, it was never intended <hi>to juſtifie them,</hi> but <hi>to reſtrain</hi> their act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>to excuſe 'em</hi> in ſuſpending their own Act till farther ſatisfaction; but it will <hi>not juſtifie them!</hi> Before <hi>what Judge,</hi> before <hi>whoſe Tribunal</hi> will it <hi>not juſtifie them?</hi> It will not juſtifie them <hi>before God,</hi> if through ſupine negligence in ſearching into the Will of God, <hi>about Sin and Duty, lawful and unlawful,</hi> they underſtand not the Bounds of their Chriſtian liberty, and yet even here the ſame God who condemns their ſinful ignorance, will not have them to give ignorant obedience: But what is this <hi>to mans judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> who knows nothing more or leſs of mens negligence than they ſhall tell him? But what if he has uſed all due means to obtain ſatisfaction in the matters preſcribed, and yet cannot be ſatisfied but that either <hi>the things are ſinful</hi> that are commanded, or the <hi>Authority incompetent</hi> by which they are commanded, will not this <hi>juſtifie him</hi> neither? Then he muſt be condemned by men, but God will ſo far juſtifie him, that he ſhall not be condemned for acting no farther than his own light directs him.</p>
               <p>This Propoſition of the Doctors he confirms by a Reaſon: <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Apoſtle makes Communion neceſſary as far as 'tis lawful, and that upon the general obligation that lies upon all Chriſtians to do what in them lies, for preſervation of the Peace of the Church.</hi> This Rule of the Apoſtle!
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49933:48"/>
I find indeed he lays down a Rule that we ſhould <hi>walk as far as we have attained,</hi> but no Rule that we ſhould walk up <hi>to the lawfulneſs</hi> of the things, but to what we have <hi>attained of their lawfulneſs; lawfulneſs</hi> is not the <hi>meaſure</hi> of our walking in this caſe, but <hi>knowledge.</hi> Things may be <hi>in themſelves lawful,</hi> but it <hi>only ſo,</hi> and <hi>no more,</hi> and a Chriſtian has not attained to <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of their lawfulneſs, if he <hi>walks ſo far as he has attained,</hi> he fulfils the Apoſtles Rule, and pleads the benefit of the other <hi>to be left to God's inſtruction.</hi> But this is the Doctor's method to confound what is lawful <hi>objectivè,</hi> and what is ſo <hi>ſubjectivè,</hi> as if the Apoſtles Rule had been, <hi>ſo far as the things are lawful in themſelves, ſo let us all walk;</hi> when as he only requires us <hi>to walk ſo far as we have attained</hi> to ſee their lawfulneſs: And both the Apoſtles Rules do ſuppoſe that ſome things are in their <hi>own nature</hi> lawful, which are not ſo diſcerned by every Chriſtian, in which piteous caſe, he commands them to be left to God.</p>
               <p>But ſtill he judges, <hi>that the Apoſtles Rule makes Communion neceſſary as far as 'tis lawful.</hi> I cannot help that! nor do I ſee that the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſpeak any thing of the Communion of Chriſtians among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for ſuch Communion may be had and maintained under very great variety of apprehenſions and practices: if Churchmen would once learn to preach up Love, inſtead of Hatred; and preach down Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſtead of Conformity to their own little Niceties. Now to make his Reaſon carry a fairer face of probability, the Doctor has cleverly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his Text, as he has all along perverted the ſenſe, and reads it thus: <hi>As far as ye have attained walk by the ſame Rule, Do the ſame things;</hi> which looks very fairly to and favorably upon, our dearly beloved <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity;</hi> but he that rides of a trotting Horſe, will never ſpie ſmall faults. <hi>Do the ſame things;</hi> i. e. Let not one Miniſter preach with an Hour-glaſs, when another has none: nor one read Service in his Gown, when the other wears the Surplice. Let not one Chriſtian <hi>ſtand</hi> at Prayer, when his Neighbor <hi>kneels;</hi> but let every man do juſt the ſame things that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does, upon pain and peril that ſhall fall thereon: And all this goodly gear hangs on a Peg that is not worth a Pin, <hi>viz.</hi> the rendring <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Do the ſame things.</hi> When all the Apoſtle commands amounts to no more than this, That we ſhould do as he did, <hi>walk as far as we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,</hi> and preſs toward the mark, the <hi>ſame mark</hi> he aimed at, and leave others to him who delights in <hi>mercy,</hi> more than <hi>ſacrifice of his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,</hi> much more than in <hi>Ceremony of mans appointment;</hi> and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely

more than in <hi>Cruelty,</hi> which men have invented to ſhew their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, but he has forbidden to demonſtrate his holineſs.</p>
               <p>Now what pretty ſport would this make the Reader, if the Doctors Anſwerer were in the humor; <hi>Let us all do the ſame things!</hi> Very good! Will then they do as <hi>we do?</hi> not for a world! Muſt we do as <hi>they do?</hi> By what authority? <hi>Ne audiantur haec verba</hi> ego dico, <hi>aut</hi> tu dicis, <hi>ſed quid dicit Dominus?</hi> No more then of this, <hi>what they,</hi> or <hi>we ſay,</hi> or <hi>do,</hi> but what has God, the impartial Umpire, determin'd between us? Is what <hi>they do</hi> nearer the Rule? we will <hi>do it with them.</hi> If our practice come nearer the Rule, are they willing to become conformable to that Rule, though they be Nonconformiſts to that Rule which is more remote? Now all the fat is in the fire, and that will make a terrible flame!</p>
               <p>Theſe Reaſonings the Doctor thinks to blow away with the breath of his mouth, and would perſuade us that we <hi>have attained already</hi> to a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the things preſcribed by <hi>their Rule,</hi> and therefore ought, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the <hi>Apoſtle's Rule,</hi> to walk up to what is ſo preſcribed. <hi>I dare ſay,</hi> (ſo he goes on) <hi>if most of the Preachers at this day in the Separate Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were ſoberly ask'd their judgments, Whether it were lawful for the People to join with us in our Publick Aſſemblies, they would not deny it.</hi> But there's more cunning in theſe words, than every one is aware of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I cannot tell what the Preachers at this day would anſwer, if they were <hi>ſoberly askt</hi> the Queſtion; but I doubt they never intend to <hi>do that,</hi> who put the Queſtion. A <hi>ſober Queſtion,</hi> deſerves a <hi>ſober Anſwer;</hi> and I have heard of a <hi>ſober, and compaſſionate Enquiry,</hi> that has been anſwer'd with more <hi>ſobriety, and compaſſion,</hi> than it deſerved: But the Queſtion now, is <hi>Snick or Snee?</hi> Turn, or Starve? Conform, or Hang? Uſe the Croſs, or bear the Croſs? And ſo we once heard the Doctrine at a Viſitation Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>That in vain had the Parliament made Laws to turn the Presbyterians out of their Livings, if men did entertain them in their Houſes, and at their Tables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If the <hi>Preachers in the Separate Meetings</hi> would thus anſwer the Queſtion, I ſhould much queſtion their wiſdom; for no wiſe man will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a Queſtion, before he underſtands it: But <hi>is it lawful to join in the Parochial Aſſemblies?</hi> It may be lawful, and it may not be lawful: It may be ſo, to join with <hi>ſome Aſſemblies,</hi> and yet not with all: <hi>In ſome parts</hi> of Worſhip, not <hi>in others:</hi> It may be lawful to <hi>ſome perſons</hi> who judge it lawful (ſuppoſing it ſo to be) when yet 'tis not ſo to others, who have <hi>not attained</hi> to ſuch a judgment.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:49933:49"/>3. I have a confidence contrary to his, That if moſt of the Preachers in the Separate Meetings were asked their judgments (whether ſoberly, or madly) about the lawfulneſs of joining with the Parochial Churches in all the parts of Worſhip, or in any Excluſive to their joining with other Aſſemblies, where the Goſpel Rule is more ſtrictly obſerved, they would flatly deny it; and let theſe Men be brought to the Poll, I queſtion not but they will carry it; and I ſuppoſe that though the Doctor preacht in the <hi>Chappel,</hi> he never took the Poll of the Nonconformiſts in <hi>Guildhall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let the Queſtion be put, Whether the People may lawfully ſeparate from thoſe Churches whereof they are regularly Members, and from thoſe Paſtors under whoſe Miniſterial conduct their own free Election has pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them, to join ordinarily and conſtantly with any other particular Churches, and they, according to Reaſon and Scripture, will anſwer in the Negative.</p>
               <p>And now the Doctor has <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> what he pleaſes, let him but now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and ſurmiſe what he pleaſes too, and the day is his own.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) He infers, <hi>If the Miniſters judge it lawful, why do they not preach it in their Congregations?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They <hi>do not</hi> preach it, becauſe they <hi>do preach</hi> it; that is, ſo far as they judge it lawful, they either preach it, or print it; or partly preach, and partly print, as the Doctor did by his own Diſcourſe or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some do not preach at all, becauſe Chriſt has found them other, and better work to do, than to preach up Ceremonies, wherein they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not being ſatisfied, are very unfit to give ſatisfaction to their people: And if we ſhould tell the people <hi>how far they are bound to comply with an eſtabliſht Rule,</hi> at that rate the Doctor has anſwer'd the Queſtion, we ſhould leave the people as wiſe as we found them.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The Doctor falls a gueſſing what ſhould be the Reaſon they do not preach this Doctrine to their people; why they keep it ſuch a ſecret in their breaſts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He conjectures it may be for fear <hi>they ſhould have none to preach to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> a vain conjecture, ſince they that preach moſt often, and open <hi>how far it's lawful to Conform,</hi> have the moſt numerous Congregations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He conjectures it may be leſt they <hi>ſhould ſeem to condemn themſelves, whil'ſt they preach againſt</hi> Separation <hi>in a</hi> Separate Congregation; that cannot be it, for they that are <hi>locally ſeparated</hi> from all Congregations, may conſiſtently preach againſt Schiſmatical <hi>Separation</hi> from any.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:49933:50"/>3. He conjectures it may be <hi>They fear the reproaches of the People?</hi> Nor that neither! for they that judge their duty ſo to preach, ſo to write, do it without reproach of the more temperate, and fear not the reproach of them that are otherwiſe. But why do not our Diviners, and gueſſers at other mens corrupt intentions preach againſt the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Crimes of thoſe that are their hearers? are there none but Diſſenters there to be railed at? have they none that live in open Adultery? none that are Common Drunkards, that for time of need could piſs out a ſcare-fire? <hi>Is it for fear they ſhould have none to preach to?</hi> or for fear they ſhould have <hi>no Pulpit</hi> to preach in? or be ſilenced, and not permitted <hi>a Tongue</hi> to preach? or is it leſt they ſhould <hi>Condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> whilſt they preach againſt the crimes of others? or do they fear the reproaches of the people, that they are <hi>half preſbyterians, ſemi-fanaticks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> parboyled puritans?</hi> I think its time for men to have done with theſe <hi>evil ſurmiſings,</hi> we have ſomthing more concerns us to judge of, than other mens hearts: when the Doctor Preacht to his auditory in <hi>Gods Name,</hi> yet he ſhould not have ſtept into <hi>Gods throne;</hi> but have left <hi>the thoughts, and intents of the heart</hi> to him, before whom they are <hi>open, and Naked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not here call over the Doctors particular inſinuations, which are ſo ſubtilly laid, that they do the miſchief, and inſtil all the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a falſe accuſation, but yet eſcape before men the charge of it: only I take notice of one thing; <hi>Is it not</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>as plainly written by St. Paul,</hi> If I yet pleaſe Men, I ſhould not be the Servant of Chriſt; as, Woe be unto me if I preach not the Goſpel? It is ſo with <hi>equal plainneſs</hi> by the Apoſtle, and with <hi>equal impertinency</hi> by the Doctor and with <hi>equal juſtification</hi> of the Nonconformiſts: for they dare not pleaſe men to the diſpleaſing of Chriſt, both which they would do, by <hi>ſacrilegious Deſertion of their Miniſtry:</hi> but Chriſts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure is not to be compenſated by mens <hi>good will,</hi> nor his love to be forfeited for fear of incurring their <hi>ill will:</hi> And on whoſe ſide the temptation <hi>to men pleaſing</hi> moſt lies, the impartial world will judge though we be ſilent.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. His ſecond particular is this: <hi>If the bare diſſatisfaction of mens conſciences do juſtifie the lawfulneſs of ſeparation, and breaking an eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht Rule, it were to little purpoſe to make any Rule at all:</hi> And to ſpeak my mind freely, unleſs the Rules that have been made in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were to better purpoſes, I know not to what purpoſe they were made at all; theſe Rules have made the world ſo irregular, and unruly: What their purpoſes were that made the Rules, I ſhall not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49933:50"/>
enquire, but what we ſee or may ſay; the event of them for many Centuries has been nothing but either <hi>blind obedience</hi> in the moſt, or <hi>neceſſary ſeparation</hi> in the reſt: And much better that all theſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane eccleſiaſtick rules had never been made; than to be made of ſuch ſinful materials as muſt divide us, ſuch dubious things, as will perplex us, or by ſuch perſons whom God has not authorized to Command us. But his <hi>propoſition</hi> I muſt except againſt upon theſe following grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) I ſhall not ſay, <hi>It is no diſtinct propoſition</hi> from the former, being only <hi>a Reaſon of it;</hi> nor that he might have found in his own diſcourſe twenty more propoſitions if this may ſtand for one; but onely make my exceptions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This propoſition like moſt of the reſt, is of an uncertain ſound. Firſt we know not what myſtery there lies in, or may lurk under that Term <hi>Bare diſſatisfaction.</hi> For this word has haunted us all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long through the diſcourſe; <hi>Barely</hi> Congregational, <hi>p.</hi> 30. <hi>Bare</hi> ſuſpending Communion. <hi>p.</hi> 20. <hi>Barely</hi> relating to acts of worſhip. <hi>p.</hi> 17. And now at laſt <hi>Bare</hi> diſſatisfaction. If he means no more than ſuch diſſatisfaction, as has no fair reaſon for it, that perhaps will not juſtify any man, in any thing he does, or does not: but there is a diſſatisfaction, well cloath'd with decent, and <hi>Comely preſumptions</hi> that the thing it's diſſatisfied about is unlawful, and it may be with <hi>probable arguments</hi> too, though it wants ſuch demonſtration, <hi>cui non poteſt ſubeſſe falſum.</hi> And this will juſtifie if not <hi>poſitive ſeparation,</hi> yet <hi>ſuſpenſion of a mans action in poſitive Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If <hi>bare diſſatisfaction</hi> will juſtifie our <hi>not acting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> (which is all we plead <hi>bare diſſatisfaction</hi> for) there is another thing that juſtifies our <hi>Communion</hi> with other Churches where we may enjoy the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt without ſuch diſſatisfaction: and that is the <hi>Command of God,</hi> which has made it our expreſs duty to walk in the ways of Gods appointment. So that if <hi>diſſatisfaction</hi> tye us up from joyning in <hi>one place; peremptory Command</hi> will enjoyn us to joyn in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This <hi>eſtabliſht Rule,</hi> that fills up both pages of his Sermon, is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal term; for ſuch a Rule may be lawful, or unlawful according to <hi>the matter</hi> of it: If the matter of it be things <hi>unlawful,</hi> there needs <hi>no diſſatisfaction</hi> of conſcience to juſtifie ſeparation from it, or the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, the will of God has already determined that point: If it be <hi>lawful,</hi> and conſcience be <hi>diſſatisfied</hi> about it; conſcience will tie up from acting according to it, though not oblige to act againſt it</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:49933:51"/>(2) His Propoſition is tardy too, in reſpect of the <hi>Reaſon</hi> he gives to back it. <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it is impoſſible to make any [Rule] which ignorant and injudicious men ſhall not apprehend to be, in ſomething or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, againſt the Dictates of their Conſciences.</hi> But let <hi>knowing and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men</hi> make the Rules, and there will be leſs cauſe for <hi>ignorant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious men</hi> to break 'em: They that will make Rules about indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, had need have more than an indifferent Judgment, more than an <hi>ordinary Wiſdom</hi> to accommodate them to the meaſure of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe for whom they are made: And in this caſe Rules ſhould ſhould not be made as men make Tobacco-Pipes and Glaſſes, on purpoſe to be broken. Tradeſmen indeed cannot live if their Wares were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal; but are Church-men more afraid their <hi>Tickney-Rules</hi> and <hi>China-Canons</hi> ſhould be preſerved than broken? It were better the whole Fry of Apparitors, Summoners ſhould ſtarve than live upon the new-made Sins of the people. But <hi>ignorant men will apprehend theſe Rules againſt their Conſciences:</hi> Let then Rules be made for the <hi>knowing and wiſe,</hi> and leave the poor ignorants to live and grow wiſer, rather than knock 'em o'th' head becauſe they want Brains. But thus it was, thus it ever will be, whileſt men will be eſtabliſhing their own <hi>Rules of Severity,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the <hi>Rule of Charity</hi> given them by the Spirit. Rom. 14.3. <hi>Let not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth not, nor him that eateth not, judge him that eateth;</hi> which was a Rule made upon as good Advice as any of thoſe made by any Church at any time ſince.</p>
               <p>Let then the Doctor pleaſe himſelf with his ſeeming Advantages from the Papers of accommodation, we need ſay no more than,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Caſe is hugely wide between what the Committee, or Sub-Committee there required of their Diſſenting Brethren, and what the Biſhops now require of the people in order to an Union.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That his Inferences are not fairly drawn from their Expreſſions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Aſſembly and their Committees were but men, ſubject to the like Paſſions with their Brethren, and therefore,</p>
               <p n="4">4. That we are not obliged to vindicate every expreſſion which in heat or haſte dropt from their Pens, nor to be concluded by their Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, which, with what has been before obſerved upon this ſubject, is enough to blunt the edge and break the back of the Doctor's Arguments drawn from their Conceſſions: And yet I cannot forbear a particular examination of ſome of them, for a taſte of the reſt.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:49933:51"/>(1) <hi>Though Tenderneſs of Conſcience may juſtifie Non-Communion in the thing ſcrupled, yet it can never juſtifie Separation:</hi> That is, he that has the Church-dores lockt upon him muſt ſtand there cooling his Toes, and never addreſs himſelf to others that are open, for fear of Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> his <hi>Scare-Crow,</hi> Separation. But for Anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We produce <hi>Tenderneſs of Conſcience</hi> for no other uſe than to <hi>juſtifie Non-Communion in the things that are ſcrupled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We produce the <hi>Authority of God</hi> to juſtifie our Obedience to all his Commands, Statutes, Judgments, and inſtituted Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We produce plain reaſon from thoſe premiſes to juſtifie our Churches: For if tenderneſs of Conſcience will juſtifie us in <hi>Non-Communion,</hi> and God's Command juſtifie us to Worſhip him according to his Revealed Will, we muſt of meer neceſſity ſeparate from a Church where we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have all the Ordinances of Chriſt, to another where we can.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We ſay, The Doctrine of the Sub-Committee, <hi>viz. That ſuch ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of Conſcience as ariſeth out of an opinion</hi> (cui poteſt ſubeſſe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum) <hi>which may be falſe, is not a ſufficient ground,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to juſtifie Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> and that of the A. B. <hi>Laud</hi>'s, who would have all Diſſenters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch Arguments for their Diſſent, require more Evidence than our Learned Doctor will allow for the <hi>Exiſtence of a Deity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Point, by the way, I ſhall a little examine, becauſe I find it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in ſome of the Doctors <hi>ſtaple-Diſcourſes:</hi> I ſhall not cite his <hi>Ireni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> becauſe he has put that Piece amongſt his Tracts that are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and ſeems weary of his <hi>Weapon-Salve,</hi> and will now truſt only to his <hi>Weapon.</hi> His <hi>Rational Account</hi> is not yet amongſt his prohibited Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Now, p. 178, 179. he thus expreſſes himſelf, <hi>It is a piece of great weakneſs of Judgment to ſay there can be no certain aſſent where there is a meer poſſibility of being deceived; for there is no kind of aſſent in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man underſtanding, as to the exiſtence of any thing, but there is a poſſibility of Deception in it.</hi> And p. 206, 207. he calls aloud to the Papiſts to come forth with their <hi>infallible Arguments to prove the exiſtence of a Deity, before they talk of an infallible way of proving the truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> And ſurely the Diſſenters are not more rigidly obliged to prove the lawfulneſs of their Separation, nor the ſinfulneſs of the Terms im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on them, by Arguments which cannot poſſibly be falſe, than all Mankind is to produce ſuch infallible Proofs for the exiſtence of the Godhead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:49933:52"/>Nay, further by what I can gather from the Doctor, he ſeems to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon ſuch principles, as plainly render it impoſſible by any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Argument to prove the exiſtence of a Deity. <hi>Orig. ſacr. p.</hi> 230. where,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He lays down this for a principle: <hi>That the foundation of all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty lies in the neceſſary exiſtence of a being abſolutely perfect;</hi> ſo that <hi>unleſs I know that there is a God, I cannot be aſſured that I know any any thing in a certain manner. Now then if all certainty doth ſuppoſe the exiſtence of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo abſolutely perfect, I muſt, before I can know any thing certainly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there is an infinity of knowledge, wiſdom, power, and goodneſs in this God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then God be the <hi>firſt knowable,</hi> and that it's impoſſible to know any thing certainly, Except I firſt know ſuch a being as God, how ſhall we come to prove his exiſtence by ſuch demonſtration <hi>cui non poteſt ſubeſſe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum?</hi> ſhall we demonſtrate a God <hi>A priori?</hi> what cauſe ſhall we find of him, upon which, and from which our demonſtration may be formed: without <hi>a cauſe,</hi> we cannot demonſtrate <hi>à priori;</hi> And ſuppoſing <hi>a cauſe,</hi> we ſuppoſe him to be <hi>no God:</hi> Shall we then proceed <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> from the Effects to the Cauſe? The Apoſtle would have gone this way, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. And <hi>from the creation of the world,</hi> have demonſtrated his <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power, and Godhead;</hi> but the Doctor has ſhut the door, becauſe we muſt firſt know there is an <hi>inviſible God,</hi> before we can certainly know there is <hi>a viſible world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. How then will the Doctor prove there is a God? why, he tells us, <hi>Orig. ſacr. book</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 367, 368, &amp;c. We muſt have recourſe to an Idea: <hi>A ſettled and conſiſtent Notion of a being that is abſolutely perfect, not</hi> (as he ſays) <hi>that there is any ſuch</hi> connate Idea <hi>in the ſoul, but that there is a faculty in the ſoul whereby upon the free uſe of</hi> Reaſon, <hi>it can form within it ſelf a ſettled Notion of ſuch a being, which is as perfect as it is poſſible for us to conceive a being to be.</hi> Well then we muſt form a Notion of God from the <hi>Uſe of Reaſon:</hi> But ſeeing that all the proceſſes of Reaſon are from things <hi>known to unknown,</hi> or from <hi>more known to leſs known,</hi> where ſhall we place our engine? where ſhall we fix the firſt foot of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs? where muſt Reaſon begin? muſt we begin with the perfections of the Creatures, to argue our ſelves into a belief of that God that made them, and therefore muſt need contain all their perfections in himſelf? this is that the Doctor has renounced; for we muſt firſt be ſure there is a God, before we can be ſure there is <hi>any thing elſe:</hi> I would begin with a <hi>Flie,</hi> an <hi>Ant,</hi> a <hi>Muſhrome,</hi> and from thence I would gradually climb
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49933:52"/>
up to the <hi>first Cauſe,</hi> but the Doctor forbids us; for we have no aſſurance that there is ſuch a <hi>Fly, Ant,</hi> or <hi>Muſhrome,</hi> till we are firſt aſſured of a God: Muſt we then leave this way of reaſoning, and ſearch for ſomething <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, Co-ordinate with God?</hi> the danger is, leſt that which is <hi>before God,</hi> ſhould prove the <hi>true God;</hi> or if any thing be <hi>Co-ordinate</hi> with God, there will be <hi>two Gods, or none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this being once the judgment of the Reverend Doctor, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by him in his Dialogues, p. 269. where he appeals to his <hi>Orig. Sacr.</hi> for this very thing, I hope they will never more expect fuller proof for the warrantableneſs of our Nonconformity, than they require to prove the exiſtence of God; and let them beware, leſt whil'ſt they trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Conſcience, where God has his Throne, they do not fight againſt him that ſits thereon, and ſo bring Heaven and Earth about their ears.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another thing collected is, <hi>That it's endleſs to hope to give ſatisfaction to tender Conſciences;</hi> and therefore they reſolve never to begin. And is it not as endleſs to give aſſent and conſent to the Impoſitions, for who knows where they will end? By the ſame Reaſon they have impoſed theſe, they may five hundred; but if the Diſtemper be endleſs, why ſhould nor the Remedy? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gave ſatisfaction to tender Conſciences, without ever fearing it would be endleſs. Men are for endleſs wealth, but not for endleſs trouble. Can any man think the primitive Chriſtians had only a Leaſe of the Rule for Indulgence, during the Apoſtles Lives, and that they muſt Fine for it ſmartly, when the next Generation came up. How much better had it been to have been left to reſtraint, and abſolute will during the Apoſtles times, with a reverſion of liberty after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe; than that the 14th <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſhould be like the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, to expire with the Apoſtles, and be buried in their Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es? There will be honeſt miſtaken Souls to the worlds end, whom Chriſt thought not too bad to redeem; and whil'ſt there are ſuch, the Church, unleſs She will be a Shrew, or a Stepmother, muſt take a tender care of them: But if it be ſo endleſs to ſatisfie theſe erring Conſciences, leave 'em to God, he can do it; and he will either forbear them, in their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or give them knowledge, whom it might become thoſe men a little to imitate, who call themſelves his ſervants.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>That Scruple of Conſcience is no protection against Schiſm.</hi> Who

ſays it is? It's only a Prohibition to afford Communion <hi>in what</hi> we ſcruple: Except when the things ſcrupled, and not ſcrupled, are ſo blended together, that we cannot ſwallow what appears lawful, but we muſt gorge that with it which appears otherwiſe; which has been the policy of ſome modern Impoſers, ſo artificially to mix the certain and the uncertain, the queſtionable with the unqueſtionable, that theſe ſcrupulous Conſciences cannot enjoy that wherein they are ſatisfied, except they will venture at that about which they are not ſo; ſo are <hi>Private Bills</hi> ſtitch'd with the <hi>Publick ones,</hi> that the more uſeful may ſell the other, which few elſe would regard: So have I ſeen idle Maſters delight themſelves to ſee their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren play at Bob-apple, where the poor young Raſcals would have been glad of a Bit, but were always prevented by the Candle.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) <hi>That the Apoſtles, notwithſtanding the difference of mens judgments, did preſcribe Rules of Uniformity.</hi> Well, but mark their proof; <hi>Did not the Apoſtles bind the burden of</hi> ſome neceſſary things <hi>on the Churches, albeit there were in thoſe Churches gradual differences of light?</hi> And will the Doctor infer hence a power to bind <hi>unneceſſary burdens</hi> upon the necks of Diſciples, becauſe the Apoſtles impoſed ſuch as were <hi>neceſſary?</hi> The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then concludes; If the Apoſtles, who were infallible, had power to impoſe <hi>Neceſſaries,</hi> much more may the Prelates impoſe <hi>Unneceſſaries,</hi> though they be fallible. But of theſe things thus much.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. Come we now to his third and laſt Propoſition, <hi>A wilful Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or miſtake of Conſcience, doth by no means excuſe from ſin.</hi> Theſe things ſurely are oddly joined together; that a <hi>wilful Error,</hi> and a <hi>miſtake of Conſcience,</hi> ſhould be made the ſubject of one Propoſition: There may be a <hi>miſtake</hi> of Conſcience, where there's no <hi>wilful</hi> Error; <hi>wilfulneſs</hi> makes every Error double, obſtinacy being added to it; but a miſtake of ſimple ignorance, makes it not <hi>half ſo great,</hi> though it makes it not to become <hi>nothing:</hi> it may excuſe <hi>à tanto,</hi> though not <hi>à toto,</hi> and mollifie it a little, though not juſtifie it, nor nullifie it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It will not excuſe from ſin!</hi> And yet p. 44. he moves this Queſtion, <hi>What Error of Conſcience doth excuſe a man from ſin, in following the dictates of it?</hi> If <hi>no Error</hi> will excuſe, why is the Queſtion put, <hi>What Error will excuſe?</hi> And if <hi>ſome Error</hi> will excuſe, why is the Propoſition laid down ſo looſely, and uncertainly? <hi>A wilful Error or Miſtake will not excuſe from ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:49933:53"/>And upon this propoſition, he makes a caſe. <hi>If a man think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bound to divide the Church by ſinful ſeparation, that ſeparation is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs a ſin, for his thinking himſelf bound to do it:</hi> which is one of the wildeſt caſes that ever was put. For, 1. It may be juſtly queſtioned whether it be poſſible <hi>for a Man in his wits to think himſelf bound to divide the Church by ſinful ſeparation?</hi> A man may think himſelf <hi>bound to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate;</hi> and that ſeparation may <hi>poſſibly</hi> be <hi>ſinful:</hi> but he cannot think himſelf <hi>bound to ſinful ſeparation.</hi> He that is <hi>bound is under a Law;</hi> He that <hi>thinks himſelf bound, thinks</hi> himſelf <hi>under a law:</hi> but it Implies a broad contradiction, for a man to <hi>think himſelf bound to ſin:</hi> becauſe that implies, that he thinks himſelf <hi>bound not to be bound;</hi> or <hi>under a law</hi> to be <hi>under no law.</hi> A ſort of men there are that think it <hi>lawful to tell a Lie,</hi> to avoid a great evil, to procure ſome great good. Yet none <hi>ever</hi> owned this principle that it was <hi>lawful to ſin,</hi> to procure the one, or avoid the other: but they pretend that to <hi>tell a Lie</hi> in ſuch a caſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch circumſtances is <hi>no ſin.</hi> 2. I very much queſtion whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any did think himſelf <hi>bound to divide a Church:</hi> he may poſſibly think himſelf bound to avoid it, but how ſhould ſuch a crotchet come in's head that he was bound to divide it: when the <hi>Church of England</hi> ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Rome,</hi> did they think it their duty, to make diviſions in it? 3. The inſtances that he gives are ſhort or wide of his caſe by many leagues: <hi>Paul thought himſelf bound to do many things againſt the Name of Jeſus:</hi> He did ſo, but not to do one thing that was ſin: The <hi>Jews</hi> thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>bound in Conſcience to kill the Apoſtles:</hi> True! but yet they thought not themſelves bound to kill them ſinfully: they wanted not pretences to juſtifie the cauſe to the World, nor untemper'd mortar to daub o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their own Conſcience; 'twas eaſie to ſay they were rebels againſt, traitors to the Emperor: An eaſie thing to cry out of hereſie, and ſchiſm, and ſects <hi>every where ſpoken againſt;</hi> nor wanted they a <hi>Tertullus</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> could accuſe <hi>Paul</hi> for <hi>a peſtilent fellow, a mover of ſedition,</hi> and a <hi>Ring-leader of a ſect:</hi> ſo that all the world ſees and the poor diſſenters <hi>feel</hi> the Truth of what the Dr. ſays, <hi>men may do very bad things and yet think themſelves bound in conſcience to do them:</hi> 4. Its freely granted by all the world, that <hi>wilful error</hi> (that is, <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> ſuch, for no man can <hi>formally</hi> err <hi>wilfully:) does not excuſe from ſin:</hi> that is, what God has prohibited, no mans errour can make a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; what God has commanded no mans errour can diſcharge him from obedience to it. Nor do we, or ever did we make Conſcience a ſtalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing horſe for theſe ends.</p>
               <p>And thus we have got through the three famous propoſitions, that ſhould have cleared up the <hi>objection,</hi> and ſo anſwered to the ſecond <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:49933:54"/>
but what are we edified by all this diſcourſe? or how do we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand either what we, or Church governours <hi>muſt do,</hi> in caſe we, or others <hi>cannot come up to the eſtabliſht rule?</hi> men are not juſtifiable <hi>in not doing what they lawfully may do:</hi> well but if they ſee not that may be lawfully done which may ſo? muſt they be left to God or no? <hi>wilful er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and miſtake will not excuſe from ſin:</hi> be it ſo! ſtill <hi>what muſt be done when men cannot come up to the eſtabliſht rule?</hi> I confeſs, I am juſt as wiſe as I was! but this is the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Sermon: He propounds an enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? <hi>p.</hi> 15. <hi>How far the obligation doth extend to comply with an eſtabliſht rule?</hi> He ſhuts one thing out of the Queſtion, then a ſecond thing out of the Queſtion; then excludes a third out of the Queſtion, and at laſt ſhuts the Queſtion out of doors, and it goes wandring up and down like a vagabond to this day: we never heard <hi>one rule</hi> to limit it: how far we are <hi>not bound;</hi> nor one aſſertion to explain it, how far we <hi>are bound,</hi> but as far as a man may conjecture by the Hum, and buz of the diſcourſe; we are bound to comply to the uttermoſt extent with every eſtabliſht rule: Again, <hi>p.</hi> 36.

               <p>But yet under this laſt propoſition, there are ſome things contained which really deſerve our moſt ſerious Conſideration. As,</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. He Infers from hence, that <hi>men ought not to reſt ſatisfied with the preſent dictates of their conſciences, for notwithſtanding them they may commit very great Sins.</hi> Much leſs then ought men to reſt ſatisfied with <hi>the preſent dictates of other mens wills,</hi> for notwithſtanding them they may commit very great ſins. Conſcience is more my rule then the dictate of of any Church: and if I ought not to reſt ſatisfied with that which God has made my <hi>next and immediate</hi> guide, I may the more lawfully examine their commands, which are <hi>more remotely</hi> ſuch. But I wonder what he would have men do? would he have us like the wandring Jew, ramble up and down for ſatisfaction, and never accept it? or to be <hi>always learning, and never coming to the</hi> ſtable and ſetled <hi>knowledge of the Truth!</hi> or <hi>proving all things,</hi> and <hi>never holding faſt that which is good?</hi> Muſt we be of the <hi>Pyrrhonian</hi> Religion, <hi>Academicks, Scepticks, Seekers?</hi> or ſhall we for two or three years be of <hi>no religion,</hi> that we may be more Impartial in our Enquiries which is <hi>the True?</hi> There is ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in what the <hi>Dr.</hi> ſays, if he had made it out: If the Dictates of our Conſcience brand ſuch a practiſe <hi>for evil,</hi> which the generality
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49933:54"/>
of ſober, pious, and knowing Chriſtians recommend as lawful, or a duty. It will become us to be jealous, leaſt any baſe luſt have bribed our judgments to paſs a falſe verdict upon that practice; and ſo in many other Caſes, but in the mean time we muſt refrain, and not act contrary to our preſent ſentiments; and if there be any practice which appears to me to be a duty from the Scripture, in which I have found the preſence of God with me, and the bleſſing of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me thereby; I ſhall ſtudy to be more confirm'd in it, and <hi>reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with my preſent dictates</hi> about it, till ſome remarkable thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken me to a jealouſie, that its not ſo clear a matter as I have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. But the Doctor <hi>is afraid</hi> (and ſo am I) <hi>that the common mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking the Caſe of an erroneous Conſcience hath done a great deal of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief among men.</hi> I wiſh he would ſtate it better then, next time, leſt the next Edition alter the Title, and call it the <hi>Miſcheif of Miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Queſtion!</hi> But where does the miſcheif on it lie? Oh, <hi>the Queſtion is generally put, How far an erroneous Conſcience doth ohlige!</hi> and if they that propound it in thoſe terms, anſwer it as the Doctor did the other, <hi>How farr we are bound to comply with an eſtabliſht Rule?</hi> It had better never been ſtated nor ſtarted than thus anſwered.</p>
               <p>To come a little nearer to him! Is the Doctor ſure the Queſtion is thus generally put. <hi>How farr an erroneous Conſcience doth oblige?</hi> I am very confident, its oftner put, <hi>whether it do</hi> at all <hi>oblige or no?</hi> And they generally determine in the negative, <hi>Conſcientia erronea, ligat, ſed non obligat.</hi> It <hi>ties a man up</hi> from acting, or may <hi>urge him</hi> to act, but can neither <hi>oblige</hi> him to do what God has forbidden, or to omit what God has made a duty. <hi>The former</hi> becauſe <hi>we take</hi> the voice and countermand of Conſcience to be Gods voice, and he that is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to act againſt that dictate, though it be not the voice of God, yet ſhews he was really prepared to have acted againſt it, if it had been ſo: And though it be the will of God we ſhould do what he has commanded, yet 'tis not the will of God, we ſhould do it with a reluctant, and tergiverſating Conſcience: The <hi>latter</hi> becauſe there can be no power ſuppoſed to be given by God againſt his own Laws, Nor <hi>King, nor Keyſar,</hi> nor <hi>Kirk,</hi> nor Conſcience can make that <hi>lawful</hi> which God has declared <hi>ſinful,</hi> nor render that <hi>indifferent</hi> which God has made <hi>a duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore after all this oſtentation of Caſuiſtical learning, the Nonconformiſts are perfectly unconcern'd, further than to clear up what he has perplexed in this matter, and in ſhort they ſay, 1. That
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49933:55"/>
                  <hi>A miſtaking Conſcience will tie up the Perſon from acting,</hi> with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that where the thing is a duty, which Conſcience dictates to to be ſinful, he ought to <hi>refrain his act,</hi> but yet is not <hi>guiltleſs in the ſight of God:</hi> but if the thing be <hi>in it ſelf indifferent,</hi> Conſcience does not only lay an imbargo upon him and commands him not to ſtir one ſtep, one foot further, but will juſtifie him in the Aporetick poſture, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any power on earth, to whom he never gave a power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex Conſcience ſo far as to make that ſin, which in it ſelf is indifferent, and Conſcience judges ſinful. 2. They ſay, that where Conſcience dictates any thing to be <hi>ſinful</hi> which God has made <hi>a duty,</hi> though this erroneous Conſcience will not diſcharge the ſoul from the duty, yet the meaſure and degree of that ſinful forbearance is to be taken from, 1. The diligence or negligence which the miſtaken perſon has uſed to procure ſatisfaction in the mind of God in that perticular. 2. From the frame of the heart towards God in other caſes, and particulars, as whether he makes Conſcience of obeying God in thoſe things, which he knows to be duties. 3. From the continuance in that omiſſion: for the affirmative precept of God, which has made <hi>doing the thing</hi> my duty, though it alwayes obliges yet does not oblige al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be doing it; and therefore a Conſcience, which chains me up from duty for a day or week, when perhaps in that revolution, the duty may not recur, is not of ſuch guilt, as that which fetters me up from acting for ſuch a time, wherein the duty has offered it ſelf frequently to my obſervance: I ſay 'tis <hi>not of ſuch guilt.</hi> I dare not ſay 'tis of <hi>no guilt;</hi> becauſe the ineptitude of the ſoul to have done it, if it had recurred in that ſeaſon, may be culpable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They ſay an erroneous Conſcience can never make that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come either lawful or a duty, which God has declared to be ſinful: Becauſe the Authority of God is greater than that of Conſcience, and can never in any Caſe be ſuperſeded by it. And becauſe <hi>negative Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> alwayes bind, and bind to forbearance at all times and in all Caſes (except there be a relaxtion in the Law it ſelf, which in ſuch <hi>Negatives,</hi> whoſe matter is not <hi>of its ſelf, and in its nature evil,</hi> there may be) ſo that what God has made ſin, ſo far as he hath ſo made it, the ſoul is tyed up for ever from doing it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They ſay that an erroneous Conſcience may ſo perplex and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle the Soul with its interfering dictates, either urging it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain as <hi>ſinful,</hi> what God has made <hi>a duty;</hi> where to refrain is ſinful, becauſe God has made it a duty; and <hi>to act</hi> is ſinful becauſe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence repreſents it <hi>as unlawful;</hi> or preſſing to act where God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to be ſin; in which Caſe to act muſt needs be ſin, becauſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49933:55"/>
God has prohibited it: and to refrain is ſinful, becauſe Conſcience tells the Soul it muſt act: And I know not what ſuch a miſerable Creature may expect, Except firſt, That God may pity it, though erroneous, if ſincere; For ſincerity is more in the ſight of him who deſires truth in the inward parts than Orthodoxy: and he ſees the general frame of the heart to be upright, becauſe it would omit nothing which it takes to be duty, though in the application of the general frame of heart to this or that particular practice it may be out moſt wretchedly. 2. That men ought exceedingly to pity an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Conſcience, both becauſe they may need the ſame commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may be tempted, they are of the ſame frail Conſtitutions, and obnoxious to the like infirmities, but eſpecially if that errour do viſibly ariſe from an evil Conſtitution of body, being naturally me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick, or from evil education, where the Errour has been ſuckt in with the Mothers milk, or the general prevailing of ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous principle in the Age which has tinctured and miſled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſeeing its much more eaſie to ſcoffe, jeer, and revile at an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Conſcience than to direct, inform, and heal it. And none are more unmerciful cenſurers of a miſtaken Conſcience, than they that never knew the worth of a truly tender Conſcience of their own.</p>
               <p>When therefore the Doctor tells us. That <hi>Conſcience alters not the Nature of good and evil in things,</hi> that <hi>what God hath made a ſin, or a duty remains ſo, what ever a mans Conſcience doth judge concerning them:</hi> He brings us no new diſcovery; no extraordinary revelation, but that common doctrine of all Caſuiſts; all the fault of it is, That its impertinent to the matter in hand, for he is or ſhould be inquiring what Power Conſcience may challenge about an <hi>eſtabliſht Rule</hi> of <hi>Mans making,</hi> and ſuch for which they have neither general nor particular warrant from God ſo to make.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. The Doctor informs us, <hi>That the moſt material queſtion in the Caſe of an erroneous Conſcience</hi> is: <hi>What error of Conſcience doth excuſe a man from ſin?</hi> which was ſeaſonably remembred, ſince <hi>p.</hi> 42. He layes it down as a Rule, That <hi>willfull errour or miſtake doth by no means excuſe from ſin.</hi> If a miſtake will <hi>by no means</hi> excuſe, I wonder <hi>what error or miſtake</hi> can do it? He anſwers by an approved diſtinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>involuntary Error,</hi> cauſed by <hi>invincible ignorance;</hi> and <hi>willful er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> when the judgment is formed by <hi>paſſion, prejudice, intereſt:</hi> Now that which I ſhall take notice of here, is only the explication of his Terms and Notions.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:49933:56"/>1. <hi>An Error wholly involuntary,</hi> is when its cauſed by <hi>invincible Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> or <hi>after uſeing the beſt means, for due information of his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> Thus the Doctor has determined; and thus we aſſume: But the Errors of the diſſenters (if they be errors) in not complying with the controverted matters, are <hi>wholly involuntary,</hi> cauſed by <hi>invincible Ignorance</hi> not being conſcious to themſelves that they have neglected <hi>the beſt</hi> or <hi>any good meanes</hi> for the better information of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; They have read the Scriptures, they have ſtudied the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, as they have been ſtated by learned men both in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and progreſs of the reformation; they have managed <hi>friendly,</hi> and <hi>unfriendly debates,</hi> conferences, diſputations with men of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions; they have earneſtly prayed to God not to ſuffer them to be miſtaken in a matter of ſo great moment, they have implored his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, what he would have them to do or ſuffer, and ſee no reaſon hetherto to alter their judgments or practiſes, and therefore hope the Doctor will become their ſecurity againſt wilfulneſs of error; and that <hi>their Act, though it may be a fault in its ſelf</hi> (which yet they do not beleive) <hi>ſhall not be imputed to them as ſin.</hi> And now whereas former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would have been content, that any Act of theirs, if erroneous, might have been pardoned in the number of their ſins of ignorance, upon a general repentance, though there had been ſome guilt in it; The Doctor has exceedingly obliged them, and to their ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort aſſured them, that <hi>their Act</hi> (ſo qualified as before) <hi>ſhall not be Imputed to them as ſin:</hi> So that things are ſomewhat better with them then they looked for, and they will returne the Doctor their humble and hearty thanks, for his good Doctrine, which makes them need <hi>no Abſolution,</hi> where there is <hi>no imputation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I only adde, that whoever pleads for mercy and Indulgence to an erroneous Conſcience (if honeſt and upright) muſt be preſumed to do it Impartially, and can be no Intereſt of his own, for no man can Judge his own Conſcience to be actually Erroneous; which plea ought to be accepted with Readineſs by all the Sons of Men, ſince no man can be abſolutely certain but he may have at leaſt in ſome particulars an Erroneous Conſcience: Nor yet will this deſtroy the diſtinction of <hi>voluntary,</hi> and <hi>Involuntary Error;</hi> for though no Error is <hi>formally vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untary,</hi> yet may it be ſo by <hi>Interpretation:</hi> that is, though he that miſtakes in any point of Doctine, doth not, cannot willingly erre, yet may be have contracted that error by ſuch ſinful courſes, that God will charge the guilt upon him as if he had willfully run into any other ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:49933:56"/>(2) Let us therefore in the next place, hear the Doctors explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>wilful error</hi> of Conſcience. <hi>If</hi> (ſays he) <hi>they form their judgments rather by paſſion, and prejudice, and intereſt, than from the laws of good or juſt Rules of Conſcience; if they do not examine things fairly on both ſides praying for Divine Direction, if they have not patience to hear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing againſt their Opinion: but run on blindly and furiouſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they may in ſo doing act according to their Conſciences, and yet be in as great danger of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting heynous ſins as St.</hi> Paul <hi>and the Jews were:</hi> which Doctrine of his being true in the main as it lies in <hi>Theſi,</hi> will need the leſs of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion upon it: yet muſt I ſay. 1. That his disjunctive; [If they form their judgements rather by prejudice, then from the <hi>laws of God</hi> or <hi>other juſt rules</hi> of conſcience] inſinuates a piece of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divinity, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are <hi>other juſt rules</hi> of conſcience, then <hi>Gods Law,</hi> which is a Notion we cannot admit of without better evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: we would gladly know where thoſe <hi>other juſt Rules</hi> are to be found? muſt we ſeek them in Canons, and Conſtitutions Eccleſiaſtical? whether then are <hi>all ſuch</hi> or only <hi>ſome</hi> of them ſuch <hi>juſt rules?</hi> If one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſome of them:</hi> which are they? and by what characteriſtical marks may we diſtinguiſh them? but if <hi>all be ſo;</hi> then muſt we acquieſce in all the Canons, decrees, reſcripts and Rules that were ever made by any Counſel or convocation; and why then did not the Church of <hi>England</hi> reſt ſatisfied with thoſe rules, which were given her before the Reformation? 2. We muſt needs ſay, that if the Diſſenters do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine things fairly on both ſides, praying for Divine Direction and have had a world of patience to boot, to hear any thing againſt their Opinion, though never ſo weak in Reaſon, and ſtrong in paſſion; (which they profeſs before the ſearcher of all hearts they have done, and continue ſtill to do,) they muſt be diſcharg'd before all the world that ſhall take cognizance of their cauſe, and hear their pleas, of any wilful or voluntary error: And for the ſuggeſtion that they <hi>form their judgments from prejudice, paſſion, and intereſt;</hi> they dare not judge of other men, contenting themſelves to have averred their own innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when the temptation viſibly lies on the other ſide.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. For a Concluſion: The <hi>Dr.</hi> would apply the charge of a <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully erroneous</hi> Conſcience to the Diſſenters. <hi>If men</hi> (ſays he) <hi>through the power of an erroneous Conſcience may think themſelves bound to make ſchiſms,— to diſobey Laws, to break in pieces the Communion of the Church, they may ſatisfie themſelves that they purſue their Conſciences, and yet for want of due care of inforcing themſelves — thoſe actions may be wilful, and damnable ſins.</hi> But we think not our ſelves bound to

any ſuch wickedneſs; There are enow that think themſelves bound t do that without our aſſiſtance; enow beſides us to perpetuate the cauſe of our diviſions, and to entail contentions upon Innocent poſterity whoſe teeth muſt be ſet on Edge with the ſowre grapes their Fathers have eaten; but if any ſhall think themſelves bound through the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of an Erroneous Conſcience to make unjuſt Rules of Conſcience, when tis Impoſſible they ſhould make one <hi>de novo</hi> that is juſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by break the Church in peices, they may think what they pleaſe, that they are purſueing their juſt rights to impoſe upon other mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and ſatisfying their own, and yet for want of a due care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves better in their duty, the extent of their power, and the ends for which it was given, be guilty in the ſight of God of will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and damnable ſins, as bad as thoſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who thought they did God good Service, when they perſecuted, and murtherd his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants.</p>

               <p>I Find the Doctor ever, and anon inſinuating that what is <hi>lawful to be done,</hi> upon ſome account or other <hi>ought to be done:</hi> Which if it be <hi>univerſally true,</hi> will take away the difference between merely law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and neceſſary, at leaſt as to uſe and practice, ſince it implies that whatever is lawful may be made conſtantly and fixedly a duty: If it were only aſſerted that what is <hi>merely lawful</hi> might through a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of circumſtances <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> become a duty, as it would do this cauſe no ſervice, ſo neither would it meet with our oppoſition: But to be thus laid down in general without further explication, needs a little conſideration, and ſo in this caſe, that which otherwiſe had been but lawful, will be incumbent on me as my duty. Two expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions I find worthy our Notice:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>I do not queſtion but in time if they find it</hi> (Communion in prayers and Sacraments) <hi>lawful, they will judge it to be their duty.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have ever thought that what was <hi>lawful and merely ſo,</hi> ſtood
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49933:57"/>
in the midſt between <hi>ſinful</hi> and <hi>neceſſary;</hi> forbidden, and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it deſerves ſome care and pains to dive into the Myſtery of it, how, or why theſe lawfulls may become determined to one ſide of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes or termes, between which they formerly ſtood neuters. And by what we can gather from his diſcourſe, it muſt be one of theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whatever we judge lawful to be done in any caſe, <hi>for peace ſake</hi> will become a duty to be alwayes done. For he tells us, p. 31. 32. <hi>There's nothing Chriſt and his Apoſtles have charged more upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Chriſtians, then ſtudying to preſerve peace and unity among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> To which pupoſe the Doctor quotes us ſeveral places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which it is needleſs here to repeat, ſeeing none ever yet denied the ſtudy of peace to be a very great, and manifeſt duty. But if it be <hi>charg'd on the Conſciences of all Chriſtians to ſtudy to preſerve peace:</hi> We hope they find the charge upon their Conſciences alſo, for they are <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Have they then ſtudyed the things that make for peace? I mean not <hi>their own,</hi> but the peace of all the Chriſtians in the Nation: A little ſtudy would have diſcovered the <hi>means,</hi> had they been as they pretend ſuch paſſionate Lovers of the end. What expedients have they then found out by all their ſtudy, or what expedients will they accept that others have ſtudied, and found out, to releive and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure peace ſo far as its loſt? to preſerve peace ſo far as it yet remaines? and to further peace ſo far as it may be attainable in the Imperfect ſtate of this life? what will they part with to purchaſe it? will they ſtep over one ſtraw? remove one ſtumbling block that lies in the way of it? will they wave the leaſt of their pretenſions? or condeſcend to others in the ſmalleſt of their deſires? will they promiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our Rubrick, that one Rule for <hi>finding out</hi> Eaſter <hi>for</hi> ever, when it would not find it out <hi>for,</hi> but proved it ſelf Erroneous <hi>in,</hi> almoſt half ſeven years? will they forbear to exact our Aſſent and conſent to a known falſhood for that excellent thing, which they ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, Peace? The matter is ſlight! yet if an Error, they can more eaſily forgoe it then we avow it: we know not why we ſhould tell the ſmalleſt lie for peace, if they will not part with one: Nay tell us what thing ſo Inconſiderate, ſo minute, which all our humble Petitions for peace, could procure the relaxation of?

and the Reader will expect other Anſwers, and that whatever becomes of others we do clear our ſelves: 1. Then, we will acknowledge that what we can <hi>lawfully do,</hi> we <hi>ought to do</hi> for <hi>peace ſake,</hi> when peace will certainly be obtained from them, by doing what we can lawfully do: but if the doing all we lawfully can, will not be accepted as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of peace, to what end ſhould we ſtretch our ſelves, and ſtraine our uttermoſt powers to reach that which can never be reacht? <hi>I</hi> will part with much of my right, deny my ſelf in what I may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, to buy my peace at the hands of a vexatious Neighbour; but if all that I can lawfully do will not purchaſe it, <hi>Its better ſaved than ill ſpent:</hi> For an Indifferent thing, that becomes good, as it tends to a good end, will yet be no good thing again, but return into its old box of Indifferents, when it tends not to that good end: Nay that which is in its <hi>general nature</hi> a duty, as relating to ſuch an excellent end, yet ceaſes to be a duty, nay becomes a ſin, when its applied to no ſuch end: <hi>An oath</hi> is a part of worſhip, and ſo far a duty; the end of an aſſertory Oath is <hi>to put an end</hi> to <hi>Controverſies,</hi> to <hi>procure peace</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men: but if an Oath of that ſort be uſed where it cannot put an end to the controverſy, it becomes ſinful, as <hi>taking the name of God in vain.</hi> 2. We acknowledge that what we <hi>lawfully</hi> can do for <hi>peace ſake,</hi> that we <hi>ought</hi> to do: But withal we affirm that we <hi>actually</hi> do it, and do it <hi>as our duty</hi> to; for ſuppoſe I find it lawful in general to hear a ſound pious Conformable Miniſter preach the Goſpel; when cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances meet together to call me out to go, I do it under the ſtrict Notion of duty: And they that find it lawful to Communicate in the prayers, and Sacraments, and the Church, do judge they are doing a duty in ſuch communion: There muſt then be ſomething elſe that the Doctor would have, if we could get out the ſecret; which his next Magiſterial aſſertion perhaps may diſcover: 3. They that judge it <hi>lawful,</hi> nay their <hi>duty</hi> to hold Communion with the Church, <hi>in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Sacraments,</hi> yet neither think it their <hi>duty</hi> nor <hi>lawful</hi> to joyne with one Church to deprive them of the lawfulneſs, and duty of joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with other Churches: leaſt whilſt they preſs after <hi>poſitive duty,</hi> they ſhould neglect a <hi>Comparative duty:</hi> for ſeeing they judge it a duty to joyne with the parochial Churches for peace ſake, and to joyne with others Churches alſo for the ſame end, they ſhew a more true and Catholick Spirit for a general peace amongſt all Chriſtians, then they whoſe Narrow ſtraight laced Souls, only deſigne a peace within the limits of their own Conſtitutions. And, 4. If it be true, that what we may <hi>lawfully do</hi> without ſin, we <hi>ought to do as our duty;</hi> why
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49933:58"/>
may not others turn the inference thus; That ſeeing its lawful to joyn with the ſeparate Churches without the guilt of ſchiſm, it will be a <hi>duty alſo</hi> ſo to joyn: for theſe that think the one lawful, think the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawful alſo: and as the argument holds on one ſide, it will hold on the other with equal force. Nay, 5. <hi>With more;</hi> for thoſe perſons againſt whom this argument is brought from their own judgment of the lawfulneſs of joyning, do judge it a more clear caſe that its lawful to joyn with thoſe other meetings, which are more near the word of God, in worſhip and diſcipline, and where the dubious Conditions of Communion are not found to raiſe ſcruples about the lawfulneſs of Communion with them, which in other places cannot but ſometimes occur. Nor will thoſe external, accidental advantages, which one ſide has got above the other vary the caſe, ſeeing 'tis the intrinſick merits of the cauſe, that conſcience regards in forming a right judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about its duty. And let thus much ſerve for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Yet I rather think, there's a further meaning in his words, which we poor heedleſs, ſleepy Creatures little dream of: <hi>I do not queſtion, but</hi> in time, <hi>if they find it lawful they will judge it to be their duty.</hi> In time? yes! all in good time? that is, when they have preacht up the Magiſtrate to a due height for perſecution; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd the Nation with another Presbyterian Plot; or retrieved that of <hi>Ax</hi>-yard, and the Meal-Tub; when they have rallied up the whole Legion of Informers, and once more given us a ſpecimen of eccleſiaſtical Grace in driving us out of our houſes into priſons, <hi>then is the time,</hi> when we ſhall all find it a duty to conform. I have no great Reaſon to be confident of my ſelf, and, I hope, I know my own heart a little better than to truſt it, nor can I tell whether one terrour may not make me think that <hi>Lawful,</hi> which I never ſo thought before, and the next make me think it <hi>a duty;</hi> a man is ready enough to ſtretch his Conſcience rather than an halter; there's no ſuch <hi>feeling convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> like that of the Statute; nine and fifty dull arguments and one <hi>ſharp ſword,</hi> will create a good title to the ſeventeen Provinces: It may be then <hi>in time</hi> we ſhall find it <hi>a duty,</hi> that is, a duty not to God, or our Conſciences, but to our Carcaſſes, and other duty upon this account is not yet diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) But the moſt probable intendment of this Paradox is: That <hi>if we</hi> find ſuch Communion <hi>lawful,</hi> the intervening <hi>authority of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi> will turn the ſcale, and make it <hi>a duty:</hi> To this I ſhall not need to ſay much, becauſe ſo far as we judge Communion lawful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49933:59"/>
the Command of the Magiſtrate, ſo far we do judge it to be a duty under due circumſtances, and no further can we judge it to be either lawful or a duty, when the Magiſtrates command has had its moſt operative influence, either upon the things themſelves, or our Conſciences, yet theſe things we take to be clear. 1. That where Communion with the Church would have been ſinful under all its circumſtances, no command of the Magiſtrate can make it lawful. 2. That no command of the Magiſtrate can diſcharge a Chriſtian from that duty which he owes his proper Paſtor, or that particular Church whereof he is a member according to Gods Word. 3. That the Magiſtrate has power from God to enforce all his Chriſtian ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to live peaceably among themſelves, and puniſh them that do otherwiſe, but not to deſtroy that for which Peace is deſirable, namely the leading a <hi>quiet</hi> and ſecure life <hi>in all godlineſs and honeſty,</hi> for <hi>he is the Miniſter of God to us for our good,</hi> and not for our ruine, 13 <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. A ſecond uncouth paſſage of the Doctors is that of <hi>page</hi> 56. <hi>Its hard to underſtand</hi> if occaſional Communion be lawful; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Communion <hi>ſhould not be a duty:</hi> I perceive he is ſomewhat hard of underſtanding, eſpecially of thoſe things that he has no mind to. In the former diſcourſe he argues from the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of Communion to the <hi>neceſſity:</hi> but here alſo from <hi>occaſional</hi> to <hi>conſtant</hi> Communion. To which confident aſſertion of his we Oppoſe this, <hi>Occaſional</hi> communion with a particular Church may be <hi>lawful,</hi> when yet <hi>conſtant fixed ſtated</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion may not be <hi>a duty:</hi> which we prove. 1. From their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and practiſes. Their Canons have made it the duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry individual member of their Church, to hold conſtant Communion with his own pariſh Church and Teacher, and yet they allow <hi>occaſional</hi> Communion with other pariſh Churches. A journey will make oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional Communion with a remote Congregation <hi>lawful,</hi> but they will hardly perſwade us that they can make it <hi>our duty,</hi> to take ſuch journeys in order to ſuch communion: If the great Bell rings at the next pariſh to a <hi>Lecture Sermon,</hi> or chimes all in to <hi>Divine Service,</hi> when we have none of thoſe at home, 'tis lawful to take the occaſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coming under a conſtant obligation to it: The diſſenters crave the ſame equity; they ſay they are under an obligation ordinarily, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, ſtatedly, conſtantly to worſhip God in thoſe congregations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are members, they ſay they can readily joyn with other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations as they have opportunity, but they cannot admit the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that becauſe they may <hi>occaſionally</hi> that therefore they muſt <hi>conſtantly</hi> practiſe it: becauſe <hi>Acts of worſhip</hi> have a larger extent then <hi>Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49933:59"/>
thoſe</hi> may be performed and yet <hi>theſe</hi> remain ſacred, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate. 2. Some <hi>conforming Miniſters</hi> and Chriſtians judge it lawful to hold communion <hi>occaſionally with the diſſenters,</hi> in prayer and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what a rare argument has the <hi>Dr.</hi> furniſht us with to prove it their conſtant duty; and from <hi>once hearing</hi> lawfully, to prove it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent duty to hear them <hi>for ever.</hi> 3. It may be lawful occaſionally to ſtep in, and hear a very weak preacher, perhaps one that is vicious in his life, or unfound in ſome points of Doctrine, when we can hear no other, will it follow that we are bound, or that any power on earth can bind us to hear ſuch conſtantly, when God has made better provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for our ſouls, and we want only grace to accept it. 4. How many have judg'd it lawful to go <hi>to a play</hi> or the Chappel at <hi>Sommerſethouſe, occaſionally,</hi> who yet think that <hi>twenty Acts of Parliament</hi> cannot make either of them <hi>a conſtant duty.</hi> 5. And how unwilling are moſt men to be argued into <hi>duty</hi> from the meer <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of the thing; The <hi>Dr.</hi> thinks it <hi>lawful</hi> to reſign one of his preferments to ſome worthy perſon that has none, and yet his own argument will hardly convince him 'tis <hi>his duty:</hi> It ſeems very <hi>lawful</hi> for him that is almoſt melted with <hi>two coats</hi> to part with one to his brother thats almoſt naked, and yet we deſpair of ſucceſs in thus arguing with him: Nay it were well if ſome men would be perſwaded that <hi>plain duty,</hi> when it croſſes worldly intereſt is <hi>duty,</hi> and we ſhould the better bear with them in denying every thing <hi>lawful</hi> to be duty. And, 6. If all <hi>lawful things</hi> may be converted into <hi>duty,</hi> and what is <hi>occaſionally indifferent,</hi> may be turn'd into <hi>conſtant neceſſity,</hi> then farewel <hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> and let man hereafter eternally mourn, or dance to the Muſick of his fetters.</p>

though I diſcontent ſome others that I have <hi>no more,</hi> and ſome will find themſelvs aggrieved that I have named <hi>that one:</hi> It is the uſe of <hi>the ſign of the Croſs in baptiſm</hi> which I intend, and have therefore ſingled out <hi>that one,</hi> becauſe it is number'd amongſt the <hi>three innocent Ceremonies,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis impoſed both on the <hi>Miniſters</hi> to practice it, and <hi>the people</hi> to dedicate their Children to God by it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1). And here I ask what Reaſon can be aſſigned for the uſe of <hi>this ſign,</hi> as it ſignifies <hi>Chriſts croſs,</hi> and <hi>him crucified</hi> thereon, as it is the ſymbol of a perſons <hi>dedication to Chriſt and his ſervice,</hi> but what will equally juſtifie the Religious uſe of <hi>a crucifix</hi> ſet up in the Church for the ſame uſe, and purpoſes?</p>
               <p>This ſign of the croſs is inſtituted by the Church. Firſt as <hi>a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of Chriſts croſs;</hi> Secondly, as <hi>a Symbol whereby a perſon is dedicated to him who died the death of the croſs.</hi> Thirdly, as <hi>a token that he ſhall not be aſhamed to confeſs the faith of Chriſt crucified, and manfully to fight under his banner againſt ſin, the world, and the Devil, to continue Chriſts faithful ſervant and ſoldier to his lives end.</hi> That theſe are the ends and uſes of that ſign, is expreſly owned, by the <hi>Canons</hi> of 1603. and the <hi>office of baptiſm in the Liturgy:</hi> Now why the image of Chriſt upon the Croſs, or a Crucifix, may not be uſed for theſe ends, upon the ſame Reaſon, nay upon ſomewhat better reaſon, we are yet to ſeek: for if a ſign may be uſed to theſe ends to make impreſſion upon our minds of thoſe ſpiritual truths, duties, and mercies, the <hi>fixed viſible Image</hi> will much better do the work then the <hi>tranſient, and ſcarce viſible</hi> ſign of a croſs made in the Air with the finger. That the Papiſts do uſe the Image of Chriſt upon the Croſs as an <hi>immediate</hi> though not <hi>ultimate object</hi> of Adoration is true; and it is as true, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not uſe the ſign of the Croſs, nor is it by us charg'd to uſe it for that end: but yet, as there is an inferiour uſe of the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> to be the <hi>Lay-mans hornbook</hi> to teach him to ſpell out a <hi>crucified Chriſt;</hi> and a <hi>Covenanting uſe,</hi> to initiate Converts in the profeſion of the Goſpel; and an <hi>obliging uſe</hi> to engage them to ſerve their Redeemer; ſo there can be no ſolid reaſon given why ſuch lower uſes of an <hi>Image or Crucifix</hi> may not be introduced, but what will equally militate againſt our uſe of the Croſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What Reaſon can be alledged why <hi>circumciſion</hi> may not be impoſed as a tearm of Union or Communion, to ſignify <hi>the circumciſion of the heart,</hi> as well as the ſign of the Croſs to ſignifie <hi>faithfulneſs and perſeverance</hi> in the ſervice of Chriſt?

                  <hi>NOthing now remains,</hi> as the Doctor thinks, <hi>but application;</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be ſo, nothing for us <hi>to Read,</hi> becauſe we have read all the reſt; but upon my word there remains a great deal more, for the Doctor to do than he has yet done, unleſs he can ſatisfie himſelf to have done juſt nothing: Here are ſeveral Propoſitions to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, his own Queſtions to be anſwered, and many things upon the ſcore not wiped off; yet let us hear his <hi>Application,</hi> which is alwayes either the beſt or the worſt part of a Sermon.</p>
               <p>He begins with a word of Advice to thoſe <hi>That continue in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Church.</hi> That <hi>they would walk by the ſame Rule, and mind the ſame things.</hi> For <hi>whileſt we keep to one Rule all people know what 'tis to be of our Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then are <hi>two ſorts of Perſons,</hi> both ſuppoſed to be in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church: Firſt <hi>The ſuper-Conformiſts,</hi> who out-run Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Convocation, Rubrick, and are got as far as <hi>Calice</hi> before ſome of their Brethren can reach <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The ſecond of <hi>Subter-Conformiſts,</hi> who jogging on their own pace, neither the high-trot, nor the Tantivey, are almoſt run out of diſtance; the former are for the high Notion of Canon-Prayer, the other form their own Conceptions in their own expreſſions, in Prayer both before and after Sermon; theſe again are ſo ſtiffe in their Hams, they will not bend at the naming the word <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but others are ſo ſupple in the joynts, they are ready to buckle at the name of <hi>Judas:</hi> Some are got into the high ſtrains of the Organ, above Canon, againſt Homilies, others content themſelves with the plain ſong of the old Metre; and from hence. 1. <hi>Quaere</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſuper-conformity,</hi> and <hi>ſubter-conformity, overdoeing</hi> the Rule and underdoing it, exceſſes, and defects in reference to the ſame Canon, be not a real Schiſm in the bowells of the Church?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Quaere.</hi> If ſo; which faction is it that makes Schiſmatick? If the Gallopers, why are they not then declared Schiſmaticks from the preſs and Pulpit? Is it for fear they ſhould loſe ſuch zealots from their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? or are they aſhamed to condemn others, for what they practice themſelves? or is it becauſe theſe Sinners are <hi>too good, too bad,</hi> or <hi>too great to be told of their faults:</hi> But if the <hi>halting Conformiſts</hi> be the Schiſmaticks, how comes it to paſs that only <hi>defects</hi> are Sins, and yet <hi>exceſſes</hi> are ſuch vertues? why is it, that a man may advance towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet be no Schiſmatick, but yet one ſtep towards <hi>Geneva</hi> makes him a damnable
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49933:61"/>
one; that it would be no crime to <hi>out-run</hi> the Conſtable, but to <hi>hang back,</hi> and give him the ſlip, when he would drag him to the Stocks, is ſuch a heinous one?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaere</hi> 3. Whether if they can relax the Rule of Severity, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the Rule of Charity towards their own brethren, to ſave them from being Schiſmaticks, they might not ſtrain a little farther to ſave the reſt of the Nation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaere</hi> 4. If it be true, that <hi>while all keep to one Rule, all people know what it is to be of the Church of England,</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will not be as far to ſeek, as ever he was to underſtand, <hi>what the Church of</hi> England <hi>is;</hi> when he cannot but ſee by mens practiſes, they either walk by <hi>no Rule,</hi> or <hi>Twenty;</hi> and when a punctual Conformiſt neither exceeding, nor coming ſhort of the Rule, is like that <hi>Temperamentum ad pondus,</hi> which unleſs in ſome Philoſophical Noddle, never yet had any real exiſtence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaere</hi> 5. If (as the Doctor ſays) it be <hi>Indiſcretion</hi> only, and ſome <hi>peccadillo,</hi> to go <hi>beyond the Rule,</hi> a good nature might not allow it to be <hi>Indiſcretion</hi> too, and no more, in thoſe that fall below the Rule? It may be demonſtrated, that <hi>ten degrees</hi> of <hi>Northern Latitude</hi> varies no more from the <hi>Equinox,</hi> than as many degrees of <hi>Southern Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:</hi> But the miſery is, <hi>Titius</hi> ſhall be a <hi>Saint</hi> for the ſame thing for which <hi>Sempronius</hi> is a <hi>Raſcal;</hi> and let him fly never ſo high above the Canon, he's but <hi>indiſcreet;</hi> when-as let him lag never ſo little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it, he's a notorious Schiſmatick.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs Conformiſts muſt own it to be wholeſome counſel which he gives them and himſelf, <hi>Let us take heed we do not give too much occaſion to our enemies, to think the worſe of our Church for our ſakes.</hi> Moſt excellent counſel it had been, had he defined critically what <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is too much,</hi> what <hi>too little,</hi> and what <hi>juſt enough</hi> to make men think evil of the Church. And his old Queſtioning method might have here been ſeaſonably revived; <hi>How far we may, or may not give occaſion to enemies to think worſe of the Church:</hi> but we never expect an Anſwer of theſe hot-ſcalding queſtions: <hi>occaſion</hi> may be given, and <hi>much</hi> occaſion, but too much occaſion muſt not; for <hi>too much is too much;</hi> and therefore whatever that may be, take heed of it.</p>
               <p>This <hi>advice</hi> was firſt deſign'd for thoſe <hi>that continue in Communion with the Church;</hi> but by ſome unhappy accident or other, it's turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>a word of reproof,</hi> nay of <hi>reproach</hi> to thoſe that are out of it. In times of common infection, they ſay, all diſeaſes turn to the Plague; and in the univerſal paroxiſm of railing at Diſſenters, even Sermons that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49933:62"/>
ſhould be <hi>Remedies,</hi> turn into the diſeaſe of railing: But what have the Nonconformiſts to do with the Exhortation given to the Conformiſts? even as much as the Doctor had to do to preach againſt them at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> Chappel. But let us hear their crime however; <hi>They blame</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Government; but if themſelves were in place, or thoſe they love or eſteem, then the Government had been a very good thing: thus do mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vary as their intereſts do.</hi> As if a Weathercock ſhould preach from the top of the Steeple one day, <hi>What Charter has Chriſt given the Church to bind men up to more than he has done?</hi> Iren. Epiſ. p. 8. And the next day ſhould tell us, that <hi>what is lawful may be made a duty;</hi> and then I am ſure the Church has power to bind us up to more than Chriſt ever did: yet it ſeems, if the Nonconformiſts might have been all made Biſhops, they had liked Epiſcopacy well enough; for my own part, I like it ſo well, that where there's one Biſhop, I wiſh there were five hundred; and yet I have heard of ſome that might have worn the <hi>Miter,</hi> but that they would not purchaſe <hi>repentance ſo dear:</hi> But he goes on! <hi>We find uniformity and order condemn'd as tyrannical, till men come in place themſelves, and then the ſame things are very good:</hi> Where the Doctor found this, except in <hi>Panciroll de rebus perditis,</hi> I cannot imagine; I never heard <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity condemn'd as tyrannical:</hi> but the rigorous forcing of Chriſtians to an affected uniformity in humane crot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets; an uniformity in practiſe, without uniformity in judgment. If all mens feet were of the ſame ſize, I ſhould never complain if their ſhooes were made of the ſame Laſt: but to pinch a foot of the ſlovens twelves, into a ſhooe of the childrens three<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, is to put conſcience into the ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers ſtocks, which next to thoſe of Biſhop <hi>Bonners</hi> Colehole, are the word one can ſit in: Nor do we abhor <hi>Order,</hi> but <hi>Innovations</hi> introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced under that ſpecious title; nor did I ever find that the Nonconformiſts were in the Biſhops <hi>Thrones,</hi> though ſome odd fellows got into their <hi>Lands;</hi> without which, perhaps <hi>neither one ſide nor other</hi> would be very ambitious of the <hi>places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the Doctor then take an <hi>occaſion,</hi> or <hi>no occaſion,</hi> little or great, to revile us; to miſrepreſent us, I am ſure his brethren are beholden to us, for by our means they have ſcaped a fine ſcowring; and the edg of that Reproof which ſeem'd to bear hard upon the Conformiſts, is turn'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt us, which the Doctor might have forborn for two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; the one, that there were none out of Communion with the Church to hear his Juniper-Lecture; and the other, becauſe he promiſed to read them their leſſon by themſelves, which they now are expecting.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. XII.</hi> The Doctors Conſiderations conſidered.</head>
               <p>HE that had ſcarce half a word to thoſe <hi>in Communion</hi> with the Church, who were <hi>preſent,</hi> has for thoſe that are <hi>out of the Churches Communion,</hi> though at the time <hi>abſent:</hi> Firſt a <hi>Squadron of Conſiderations;</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>a Pacquet of Advices.</hi> His Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are now to be conſidered, which are preciſely four.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The firſt thing we are to conſider, is, <hi>How many things muſt be born in the Conſtitution of a Church?</hi> A world, no doubt in ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, by thoſe that are ambitious of their Communion. Now that we may not be in arrere in civility, we humbly deſire all thoſe whom it may concern to conſider: 1. What our conſideration will ſignifie, unleſs we had a Commiſſion of <hi>Terminer</hi> as well as <hi>Oyer?</hi> If we might <hi>bear</hi> what we could, and forbear what we could not, it might be worth the while to conſider what muſt be born: but if the Impoſers will conſider what they pleaſe to lay on our ſhoulders, and we have no conſideration left us, but whether we will bow or break under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, what place for conſideration? 2. We deſire it may be conſidered alſo, what may be forborn by them, as well as born by us; and that in order to Peace and Union: but it's plain, they are all for our <hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and nothing for their own <hi>forbearing;</hi> which yet had been more proper to his Text, had he conſidered that it is the will of God that they that have <hi>not attained</hi> to the ſame ſtrength, ſhould not be charged with the ſame burden. 3. It ought to be conſidered alſo, how many things may <hi>not be born,</hi> as well as how many <hi>muſt;</hi> for when the Intolerable are removed, we ſhall the better bear the reſt; but if we muſt bear <hi>either all, or none;</hi> to what purpoſe is our Conſideration? 4. We have conſidered again and again, both the <hi>tolerabiles &amp; intolerabiles Ineptias;</hi> which I Engliſh the <hi>tolerable and intolerable unfitneſſes,</hi> and know not how to bear either of them. And 5. it's more our intereſt to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how we may get ſtrength to bear the <hi>diſpleaſure of the Impoſers,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:49933:63"/>
than <hi>the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad of the Impoſitions,</hi> ſeeing we could eaſily avoid the one, if we could but eſcape the other. 6. We deſire it may be conſidered a little, that there are different degrees of ſtrength in Chriſtians, all have not the ſame Bajulatory backs, nor the ſame Herculean ſhoulders; and therefore it might become Church-Governours to ſit down and conſider, whether it be agreeable to the mind of Chriſt, that the weak ſhould bear the Imperious paſſions of the ſtrong, and not the <hi>ſtrong bear the infirmities of the weak,</hi> Rom. 15.1.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Doctor would have us conſider, <hi>how impoſſible it is to give ſatisfaction to all.</hi> We have conſidered that too! and hope he will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether there may not be found a <hi>Medium</hi> between <hi>giving ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all, and to none.</hi> Methinks this might ſatisfie all, if they that are ſo zealous for Ceremonies might have their belly-fulls of 'em; and they that are more indifferent for 'em, might not have 'em cram'd down their throats. He was reputed a wiſe Countrey-Juſtice in his time, who ſatisfied all his Neighbours contending about the old Ceremony of <hi>Chaucers Ale-ſtake,</hi> and determined it thus: Neighbours! you that are for a <hi>May-pole,</hi> ſhall have a <hi>May-pole;</hi> and you that are for <hi>no May-pole,</hi> ſhall have <hi>no May-pole.</hi> Chriſtians that have out-grown their Juvenile-vanities, can be ſatisfied with <hi>a worſhip adorned with Goſpel-ſimplicity;</hi> but if any muſt have a better, let the children be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, rather than bawl and diſturb the family.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor would have us conſider further, <hi>How many things muſt be allow'd a favourable Interpretation? how many things muſt be born? how many things muſt be allow'd a favourable conſtruction?</hi> I fear they are <hi>Sans number.</hi> Now if <hi>our Interpretation</hi> might ſtand for <hi>Authentick,</hi> and they would allow us to add <hi>our Interpretation</hi> to <hi>their Text,</hi> this were ſomething. In the mean time, let them be pleaſed to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a more favourable Interpretation ought not to be put upon the principles and practiſes of Diſſenters, without wreſting, vexing, tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to a ſenſe beyond, and againſt their intentions? And further may it pleaſe them to conſider, whether a more favourable Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought not to be put upon their own Conſtitutions: for it cannot be expected that any ſhould interpret them favourably, if they themſelves Interpret them rigidly: And the execution of Laws and Canons will tell us what conſtruction they put upon them that beſt underſtand 'em. It cannot be hidden what an Interpretation has been made of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute againſt <hi>Popiſh Recuſants,</hi> to torment poor Proteſtants, who are brought within the <hi>laſh</hi> of it, though out of the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of it. And
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49933:63"/>
laſtly, we humbly deſire it may be a little better conſidered, that the Impoſed matters are in <hi>their</hi> judgments indifferent, in <hi>ours</hi> ſinful, which is like the <hi>Quid ſi?</hi> to an Atheiſt, that can never be anſwered; And ſeeing (as the Doctor ſays) <hi>ſomething will be amiſs either in Doctrine, Diſcipline, Ceremonies or Manners</hi> (he might have added, <hi>or in all)</hi> that they who have the power in their hands, would either rectifie what is amiſs, or however not compel others to comply with what they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſs to be ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) He would have us conſider, <hi>How Separation of the people from our Churches comes to be more lawful now, than in the days of our Fathers?</hi> But had it not been more becoming a rational Divine firſt to conſider, <hi>whether it be ſo or no,</hi> before it be conſidered <hi>how it came to be ſo?</hi> Many men are ſo haſty, they leap over the ſtile before they come at it. 1. Then, Separation was as <hi>lawful then,</hi> as 'tis now, had they ſeen with our eyes; and as <hi>unlawful now,</hi> as then, if we ſaw with their eyes, I mean the eyes of Conformiſts; for ſuch are they who are produced againſt us. And what an odd argument is it to quote them for our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were their own Grandfathers? 2. It would be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered whether the Separation of former times was not much greater than that of the preſent time, for they proceeded to ſet up their <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries,</hi> their <hi>Synods,</hi> their <hi>Provincial</hi> and <hi>National Aſſemblies,</hi> formed themſelves into ſeparate bodies for Government, and were ſoundly ſmok't for it in the high Commiſſion. 3. And yet if in any reſpect the Separation be greater now than it was then, it is becauſe there are more ſevere terms put upon the Paſtors of Churches; and they being removed from the Benefices, the Flock did not judg that a ſufficient diſcharge from, nor diſſolution of their relation, and therefore adhered to their true and only lawful Paſtor, and by conſequence a Separation followed: Nor were the Miniſters of old haggled off their legs with a quarter of the Oaths, Subſcriptions, Declarations, Renunciations, that now they are; and they that took ſuch care to throw the Paſtors out of Churches, muſt be reſponſible to Chriſt, if the people follow'd them. And in thoſe former days there was much connivence and Indulgence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed towards the Nonconformiſts in ſome obſcure places, where lay no temptation to a <hi>quare Impedit;</hi> but we have mended the matter, as <hi>ſowr Ale does in Summer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Laſtly, He would have us conſider, <hi>The common danger that threatens us all by our diviſions;</hi> which if ſome late Preachers had well
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49933:64"/>
conſidered, they had never blown up the ſparks of perſecution againſt Proteſtant Diſſenters; we are willing to conſider the <hi>common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> that threatens <hi>us by our Diviſions;</hi> Are they as willing to conſider and remove the Cauſes of the Diviſions which heighten the common danger? If the danger be <hi>common</hi> to both, why is not the <hi>ſecurity</hi> ſo too? Muſt the Diſſenters only be in danger on all hands? Wiſe men, that can foreſee a <hi>common danger,</hi> ſhould not deſtroy one half of their friends, that the <hi>common enemy</hi> may with more eaſe deſtroy the other. The firſt Conqueſt <hi>Rome</hi> made of <hi>Brittain,</hi> was by this error of the Natives, <hi>Dum ſinguli pugnant omnes vincantur;</hi> and we hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh that in their next attempt, they proceed not upon the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the ſame <hi>Maxim.</hi> In which Devaſtation, though all are like enough to ſhare in the <hi>common miſery,</hi> yet their ſhare of the ſin will be the greateſt, that would hazard every thing, rather than part with any thing: that would loſe the Horſe to ſave the Saddle, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps one hair of the Horſes tail. They that are ſuch admirers of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and will yeild nothing to procure it; and have ſuch appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of <hi>Popery,</hi> and yet will do nothing to prevent it, muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume ſtrangely of the ſtrength of their Rhetorick, or think meanly of the weakneſs of our Reaſons, if ever they hope to Proſelyte us into the faith of it. As for <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> how vigilant and active they have been againſt the Deſigns of <hi>Rome;</hi> how Cordially they have eſpouſed the common Engliſh Proteſtant Intereſt, without regard to their private pretenſions; how zealous they have been for His Majeſties Perſon, Government and Intereſt, let others ſpeak, we ſhall be ſilent.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Advice</hi> to thoſe in Communion with the Church, was ſhort and ſweet, but the Diſſenters ſhall now have it by <hi>Wincheſter</hi> meaſure.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. And firſt we are adviſed, <hi>Not to give encouragement to raſh and intemperate zeal.</hi> We thankfully take his advice, and humbly return our own; <hi>Not to give encouragement to raſh and intemperate Railing;</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:49933:64"/>
whether he <hi>gave,</hi> or his <hi>ſucceſſor</hi> took without his giving, any encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, to let fly at <hi>Meroz,</hi> to vomit up a whole Pulpitful of Gall, we muſt no determine; but if the <hi>quatuor tempora,</hi> four times a year, or ſo, would ſerve their turn to revile us, we could be content; but this intemperate railing grows very tedious. That <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> ſeldom ſaw <hi>any good end of Councils,</hi> we eaſily believe, and have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the leſs hope of <hi>Convocations;</hi> for my part, I obſerved nothing more in the Nation, than an univerſal tendency to mutual love and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, till that of late ſome fearing we ſhould be too happy, beat up the <hi>Pulpit-drums</hi> to awaken drowſie perſecution.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. He adviſes us <hi>not to be always complaining of our hardſhips and perſecutions.</hi> That's, I confeſs, ſomewhat a hard chapter, to be <hi>always forced,</hi> and <hi>never allow'd</hi> to complain: Let them either take away <hi>the cauſe of Complaint,</hi> or our <hi>ſenſe of the Cauſe;</hi> and we ſhall either not need the advice, or quickly take it. To vent inward griefs in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſions, is ſome little relief to an oppreſſed heart, that muſt either breath or break: but thus paſſionate Mothers ſometimes whip the child till it cryes, and then whip it for crying: which a blunt great man once expreſt in more ſlovenly phraſe; To beat a Dog till he ſtinks, and then beat him for ſtinking: which had never offended the Readers ears, if the Doctor comparing the Separators to <hi>Dogs,</hi> p. 7, 8. had not warranted the Decency of the expreſſion.</p>
               <p>Nor yet do we <hi>always</hi> complain of our hardſhips, nor with uncivil reflexions, nor at all of <hi>our Prince,</hi> in whom we might be compleatly happy, if ſome Inſinuators did not intercept his Royal Propenſities to Grace and Mercy.</p>
               <p>How eaſie is it for them that are at eaſe, to read Lectures of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thoſe in miſery! thus we adviſe the poor ſick patient to pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and gravely reprove his ſighs and groanings. <hi>Omnes Conſilium facilè aegrotis damus.</hi> And thus the keepers of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> pity their wretched priſoners; telling them they do ill to complain of their hard fare, ſince a ſpare diet is more for the health of them that want air and exerciſe: thus did <hi>Julian</hi> anſwer the complaints of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> That he had taken away nothing from them, but what was <hi>a hindrance to their ſpiritual race;</hi> and now they might more eaſily thruſt in at the narrow gate, when he had ſtript them of the worlds cumber: but to pinch us, and then command us not to feel, is to chew the bullet, that the wound may be more incurable, the anguiſh more intolerable. We will not ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 16. v. 4. <hi>If your ſoul
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49933:65"/>
were in our ſouls ſtead we could heap up words againſt you;</hi> but this we may, that ſeeing he will neither allow us to <hi>lay down</hi> our burthens, nor <hi>complain</hi> of them, we will allow our ſelves to complain of our ſins, and when we are diſcharg'd of thoſe, we ſhall bear other loads the better.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. We have this <hi>Advice, Not to condemn others for what we our ſelves have practiſed, and think to be lawful.</hi> 'Tis good counſel. Nor do we remember that ever we perſecuted our brethren for <hi>non-compliance with our inventions;</hi> nor, that we know of, did we ever ſilence two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Miniſters at one clap for ſcrupling our modes of worſhip. The heats and animoſities of Brethren ought to be bewailed, not imitated; and though they have not ſilenced each other for trifles, yet the wiſe God to take down their ſtomacks has choſen they ſhould ſuffer by others hands and not their own.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor turns his <hi>Advice</hi> into <hi>Accuſation,</hi> and draws up a Charge againſt the ſeveral ſorts of Diſſenters from <hi>their own practices.</hi>

there, for which his Doctorſhip came upon the ſtool of repentance; but ſuppoſing the information true, he muſt firſt weigh all the circumſtances of it, before he can juſtly condemn them, and then ſhow that we have practiſed the ſame thing we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn in others.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) He has a fling at the <hi>Quakers</hi> too: <hi>Who notwithſtanding the ſingle independency of every mans light within, have found it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make rules and orders among themſelves to govern their ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to which they expect an uniform obedience, and allow no liberty out of the Power and the Truth.</hi> And let them <hi>expect it,</hi> ſo long as they do not <hi>exact it:</hi> I am confident thoſe perſons will not condemn the Clergy for their <hi>higheſt expectations,</hi> if they would forbear their <hi>rigid exactions.</hi> I ſee then plainly ſome mens dealings are harder than their arguments: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> may be good; who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it, is not much conſiderable, all the controverſie lyes, what the matter of which it muſt conſiſt, what the rules by which it muſt be enjoined, ought to be.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. His next advice is, <hi>Not to inflame the peoples heats by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their differences with the Church of</hi> England <hi>to appear greater than they are.</hi> They that complain of other mens heats, ought to cool their own; but thus the <hi>Torrid Zone</hi> may ſend a Pacquet of Advice to the <hi>Temperate, not to inflame the peoples heats.</hi> They <hi>that make the differences,</hi> not they that <hi>make 'em appear,</hi> are the dividers; nor have we made 'em appear greater than they are, though ſome have made 'em greater than they need be: If we preach this Doctrine to the people, <hi>that the Pariſh-Churches are true Churches,</hi> they will never believe us, ſo long as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Doctor, That one Church, one Altar, one Baptiſtry, and one Biſhop</hi> (in his ſenſe) were of the ſame extent and latitude; and all the reſt but <hi>Occaſional Meetings,</hi> pag. 27. and if we ſhould preach to them, that if <hi>Occaſional Communion be lawful, conſtant communion will be a duty,</hi> they would but laugh at us, and perhaps we ſhould ſmile a little at our ſelves: That the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have (as the Doctor ſays) <hi>ſome little intereſts of their own,</hi> is very true; little, very little intereſts they are, but if he will thence conclude, they <hi>prefer 'em before the honour of Chriſt, and the peace of the Church,</hi> he may give proof of his great <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> but not his conſcience. In the mean time the Doctor might have done well to ſuſpect his own <hi>great intereſts</hi> in the world, before he had reflected on their <hi>little ones.</hi>

                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:49933:66"/>§. 5. Another branch of his Advice, is, <hi>Not to harbor, or foment unreaſonable jealouſies in peoples minds concerning us:</hi> i. e. <hi>That we are not hearty and ſincere in the Proteſtant Cauſe.</hi> To this I only ſay, I ſhall never hereafter entertain one thought that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>marching towards Popery;</hi> for ſince I read this Sermon, and the definition of the <hi>Church of England</hi> therein, I deſpair of ever knowing who or what the <hi>Church of England</hi> is. Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth uſed to ſay, when he was a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> he was <hi>pretty ſure,</hi> when a <hi>Cardinal</hi> he <hi>began to doubt,</hi> but when <hi>Pope he abſolutely deſpaired of his ſalvation.</hi> I have ſometimes thought it <hi>eaſie,</hi> of late I found it <hi>hard,</hi> but now I ſee it <hi>impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> to underſtand this ſecret. As for his advice we do thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept it, and ſhall not <hi>harbour or foment one unreaſonable,</hi> if they will be ſure not to give in <hi>reaſonable ſuſpicions</hi> of their inclinations that way. And we do humbly intreat them to give us no more grounds for our jealouſies than they needs muſt; for if they do, though we may be ſo modeſt as not to <hi>foment</hi> them in others, it will be difficult <hi>not to harbour</hi> them in our ſelves. For if whilſt they cry out we are all undone for want of <hi>unity,</hi> they continue the <hi>impediments</hi> which obſtruct it; and when they thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt <hi>ſeparation,</hi> they continue <hi>the cauſe of it:</hi> If they ſpeak hard words againſt Popery, and give harder blows to Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy both at home and abroad; or if whilſt they give the <hi>Papiſts</hi> a gentle fillip, they reach diſſenting Proteſtants a ſound rap; if they will ſtill proceed to repreſent all but themſelves as ſilly in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſeditious in their practiſes, and diſloyal in their deſigns; we may perhaps perſwade the people to ſay little, but they will pay it with thinking.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Laſtly, He concludes with this Advice, <hi>Not to run the hazard of all for a ſhew of greater liberty to our ſelves.</hi> This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice may be wholſome for ought we know, and we may take it when we underſtand it. At preſent we know not what we have worth the keeping, if our Conſciences be once loſt. If he intends we ſhould not hazard <hi>ſubſtances</hi> for <hi>ſhews,</hi> we ſhall hearken as far as we may; but if he means we ſhould not be wrought upon by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to petition or endeavour a <hi>general Toleration,</hi> his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is already taken, and ſo becomes our praiſe: we have not done it, we ſhall not do it, though their continued provocations and perſecutions tempt us daily to it; and ſome are ready to ſay, What matters it by whom we are undone, if we muſt be undone?

but it's very wonderful that wiſe men can yet ſee no difference be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween a little <hi>moderation,</hi> and <hi>univerſal toleration;</hi> nor can diſtni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guiſh between the toleration of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and forbearing <hi>two or three Ceremonies.</hi> An <hi>univerſal Toleration</hi> (ſays the Doctor) <hi>is like the Trojan horſe which brings in our enemies without being ſeen.</hi> It was well rymed however, becauſe Toleration of Popery will bring in our enemies <hi>moſt viſibly.</hi> No! it's ſecret connivence, under hand encouragement, that brings 'em in, in Maſquerade, which open toleration would bring in bare-faced and naked.

               <p>As I abhor cruelty towards all men upon the ſole account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo ſhall I never plead for Indulgence to any, who diſcredit Religion with ſuch practices, or mix it with ſuch Principles as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb Government, and deſtroy the ends of all ſociety; the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is the Peace-keeper, and is intruſted by God to ſuppreſs and puniſh the violaters of it.

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>THus have I at length rub'd through the <hi>Reverend</hi> Authors Diſcourſe; and upon a Calm Reflexion on my work, do not think I can diſpleaſe any one more than my ſelf: Such is the common fate of eager Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants, that whilſt they would reach a knock at their <hi>Antagoniſts,</hi> they loſe their blow, and wound themſelves: ſo eaſie it is, while we are <hi>ſcribling,</hi> to forget that we are <hi>dying;</hi> and that our <hi>Sand</hi> runs faſter than our <hi>Ink:</hi> If the late change of <hi>Ink-horns,</hi> into <hi>Inck-glaſſes,</hi> had but taught us how <hi>frail</hi> and <hi>brittle</hi> we all are, it had been the moſt <hi>innocent ſignificant Ceremony</hi> that ever was invented. I could wiſh there were a <hi>General Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors Office</hi> erected, to take the Account, what all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes amount to, and 'tis probable the <hi>Total</hi> would be this, That the Contenders have loſt more, than ever their Readers gained. Thus zealous Gameſters win and loſe awhile, till at laſt the <hi>Box</hi> gets the ſtakes, and its well if the unconcerned by-ſtanders come off ſavers: And yet when we condemn, and ſeem to bewail our wranglings, we go on, and wrangle ſtill, like little children that ſcratch and bite, and cry together: But the Diſſenters have one Plea, That in theſe <hi>Piracies</hi> they are not the <hi>Aggreſſors,</hi> but ſtand purely on their juſt Defence: If the <hi>Winds</hi> could be quiet, the <hi>Waves</hi> would not tumultuate; but poor <hi>Neptune</hi> bears the blame of all the <hi>Mutinies</hi> in his Kingdom, when <hi>Aeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> only is guilty of the diſorder. If their Oppoſers
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49933:67"/>
could hold their <hi>hands,</hi> the Diſſenters would eaſily rule their <hi>tongues</hi> and <hi>pens,</hi> and would ſilently ſuffer ſilent perſecution: That which goes to the quick, is this, That men cannot be content to ſhoot their <hi>keen arrows,</hi> except they poyſon them with <hi>bitter words;</hi> like the Serpent that pierces with his teeth, and infuſes his venom along with his biting. It is far more eaſie to pluck up the Flood-gates, than having once done it, to ſhut 'em down again. We have ſeen the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a Controverſie, which may perhaps outlive our Funerals, and the next age may lament thoſe wounds which the preſent has got, but ſleeps it out, and feels not. But if we <hi>muſt,</hi> or <hi>will</hi> reciprocate this <hi>Saw of Contention,</hi> what need to go down to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins</hi> to ſharpen the <hi>Polemical Cutlaſs,</hi> when we have <hi>a file</hi> at home will give it too much keenneſs. I owe the Reader and my ſelf this debt of Juſtice, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, That I have not to my knowledg gratified any baſe luſt in this my Anſwer; I have ſteered by the compaſs of Truth, and have not vered willingly from it, though perhaps I have not always made the point I aimed at. I muſt further profeſs, That I have thoſe awful thoughts of the <hi>Reverend Doctor,</hi> whoſe Tract I pretend to Anſwer, that he has equalled moſt, and excelled many of thoſe Worthies, who have maintained the Proteſtant Cauſe againſt inſulting <hi>Rome;</hi> but in this Cauſe he has gone below himſelf, and many others, which I do not impute to any want of Controverſial skill, but the intrinſick weakneſs of the Cauſe he defended, and the real ſtrength of that he oppugned; and ſeeing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than others into the true ſtate of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, he diſcerned the feebleſs of other mens Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but yet through the iniquity of the matter,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49933:68"/>
could find out none better of his own. And laſtly, I muſt openly profeſs, after all I can hear, or read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cauſe of Nonconformity, I am more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that all the wit of man can never prove the Diſſenters in their way of worſhip guilty of <hi>the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of Separation,</hi> nor juſtifie the exacters of ſuch terms of Communion as are <hi>no way</hi> commanded by the word of God, <hi>no way</hi> neceſſary to the executing of thoſe Commands; but they muſt remain ſtill guilty of <hi>the Miſchief of theſe Impoſitions.</hi>
